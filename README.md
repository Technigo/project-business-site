# Business Site

In this project a business site was to be created. It should include a form, an accordion and a hero image. 
This project also involved an introduction to Javascript, which was used to create the accordion. I decided to create a website for a fictive company offering virtual assistant services. 

## The problem

I started with building the header with the hero image, where I started with the HTML and then styled it with CSS. I happily noticed that the learnings from last week was of great help, and I used flexbox to create the layout for most of the site. I struggled a bit with Javascript, but did practice a lot in Codepen until it actually worked. What I learned after a whole lot of struggling was that ' ' should be used in order to make the JS work, instead of " " as is typically used for HTML and CSS. I found the form quite easy to build, much thanks to Van's lecture. I did struggle with getting the httpbin to work properly, but it turned out I didn't put type submit to the button. When I discovered that, and added it, it worked perfectly fine. If I were to put more time into this project I would add some more Javascript functionality by adding some icons.
