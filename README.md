# Project Business Site ðŸ‘”
This week's project was to create a site for a company of our choice (an existing one or fantasy). 
The main requirements were to have" 

- "Hero" image/video 
- Signup form with: 2 x Text fields, 1 x A password field, 1 x Set of radio buttons, 1 x Set of checkboxes,1 x Submit button (submit it to httpbin)
- Accordion element 


# MOLECULES ðŸ§ª
I decided to build MOLECULES, a business that allows you to make your own fragrance, built with all sorts of molecules! 
The theme of the site was based in my passion for perfume and I wanted the design to be quite ethereal but strong at the same time, like most perfumes I like. 

## Planning & The Problem ðŸ§©

I applied a lot of knowledge I acquired in last week's project. I used flexbox to structure the layout the page and mobile first approach for responsiveness and decided to have a subtle signup form for mobile and tablet and then a different styled form for the desktop version.

Initially I was going to have a hero image but then switched to a video because I wanted to have the challenge of making it responsive across devices, so my approach was to have 3 different videos with different sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile, so depending on the device, the appropriate video will load and be shown.

I had quite a bit of trouble with the accordion element, as I couldn't  ully understand the Javascript code yet. But a codepen exercise and quite a bit of google search did help and I managed to make it work in the end.
