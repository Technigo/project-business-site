# Business Site

Building a business site for my own company, Ida Halling photography.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Started by building the form and accordian and did some styling after, started of in figma but ended up drawing. 
Using forms and accordian. Used the js attached, and took the allready written code and clues from teatchers. 

## View it live


Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
