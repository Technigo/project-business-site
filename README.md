# Week 3: business site

We had this week to create a business webpage with an image or video header, a signup form and an accordion in order to practice image backgrounds and HTML form, and to learn to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

I started by creating the design with Figma, to figure out how I wanted everything to be placed. For the coding, since I am now confortable with creating a webpage, I started with the form. When I felt that I was fine with that, I made the header and after that the two boxes with signup form and accordion. I wanted to use only flexbox this time, so I am more comfortable with this layout. My CSS is structured with mobile first approach, so I used some media queries for screens >1024px. When every required part was there, I tried many JavaScript functions, with quite the results I wanted.

If I had more time, I would try to find more efficient ways in my JavaScript file, but it was the first time I used that, so I am more than happy with the resultng webpage.
