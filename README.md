# Business Site
This is a project that I made during the Technigo Bootcamp, spring 2021. 
The task was to build a business site with a responsive Hero header section, an accordion section and a forms-section.

## The problem
I mainly used the sources provided by Technigo. For this project I really tried to be more structured. I planned and did so that I did one section at a time, and pushed it to Github when I had the basic design and function done. So I was a lot more structured. 
For the next project I want to plan and structure even better to be more effective.

If I had more time I would try to add more styling and maybe some more javascript. I would make it more advanced to learn even more!
