# Business Site

This project was Technigo's boot camp week 3 project and the goal was to create a business one pager website that contains an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion (with JavaScript).

## The problem

I used position relative / absolute to place the navbar top of the hero section, which contains the background image and the title of the webpage. I used JavaScript to make functionality to the accordion. With for loop I manage to make a function which controls that on click it opens the answer div for different questions. Inside of the for loop I change the height of the answer div to make it unvisible and visible on click. I also used JavaScript for the form, so that on submit it opens text telling that booking is done and makes the form unvisible. Here I just changed the style of display between none and flex. 

If I would have time to improve this webpage I would learn more about styling a form, because there is a lot of different css techniques to do this and it was not that intuitive.
