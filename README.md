# Business Site

The assignment was to creat a business site with the following features; a hero image or video, a sign-up form and an FAQ-section, accordion style.

## The problem

I built the different sections one by one, added media query, added the JS funcionality to the accordion. Then I styled it in CSS.

I didn't know until I've finished everything that a functioning JS-script was already in the js file. So I struggled a lot to make it work, I used a var and made the funcion so that it the class display changed from "none" to "block" when the question-box was toggled.
Only later did I find out we could to it in another, maybe simpler, way.
If I had more time I would try to write the JS-function in another way and maybe in that way I could make the +-sign change to -.
