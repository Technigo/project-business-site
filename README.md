# Business Site

A simple business site containing hero section, accordion & contact form.


## The solution
#### Hero
I used a video only for desktop due to performance issues. In smaller devices I used a background image with a fixed height. 

#### Accordion
I targeted all the questions and then made a for loop to return a single element. Also added an animation with keyframes to avoid the issue with using a fixed height on the answer.

#### Form
I used placeholders instead of displaying the labels on each input, though I made sure they're still visible to a screen reader. I also added some validation and a focus effect to the inputs.

If I had more time I would make an accordion answer close when opening another.
