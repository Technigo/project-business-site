# Business Site

This was a project I did as part of Technigo Boot Camp.

The assignment was to create a (fictional or real) business site including a form, an accordion and a hero section. This assignment was mainly CSS/HTML but we got a first peak into the world of JavaScript when creating the accordion. 

## The problem

My learnings from the weeks prior was that I tend to focus a lot on design and in order to give my self more time to focus on the actual coding and less on drawing up design, I decided to create a site for a real brand. My sister in law has her own accouting business with a really nice website and brandning, but she does not currently have a any type of sign up form or accordion so I asked her if I could use her brand and create this. 

So I asked her what she would like to have in a form and she explained it would be good to have a request for a quote type of form which includes quite a bit of information from each potential client. 

So i build the site by trying to achieve the same look and feel as her current site, which was a fun challenge. I then built the form and accordion to her wishes. 

After achieving the general requrements (and since I this week didn't have to think so much about what to design) I had some extra time to focus on strech goals, which included styling the form elements and adding some extra functionality to the accordion, which was so much fun (but took me many hours...)!

# If you had more time, what would be next?
- I would include a hamburger menu for tablet and mobile devices
- I would look into styling the slider elements (did not have time for this)
- I also wanted to create a form that expanded different inputs depending on what the user answered. So for example if they answered yes to X question, a series of follow up questions would appear. For this user case this would have been useful since the form became quite long and there were still items I decided to leave out.
