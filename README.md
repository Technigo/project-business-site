# Business Site

Make a business page with a hero image or video, an accordion and some kind of form with diffrent inputs.


## The problem
I started do look around on diffrent webpages with forms and accordions to get inspired. Then I looked at all the study material and looked the lectures with Maksymillan and combined them to get an understanding of the task. 

For the header I used a video as the hero and an "overly" to get the text and button över the video. 

In the "form" I used input types; "text" for the "first name" and "last name", "email" and then radio buttons for the choices of "female", "male" and "other".
Then i submit button and all this is in a <form> with action="http://httpbin.org/anything" and method="POST".
  
  Then i did a second form with a "messagebox" that you can use with out using the other form. I put an limit how many characters you could write to a max of 90. 
  
  For the accordion i used javascript to make the panel go down when i press on the "button" and up again when pressed again. On the accordion i used content:"\25C9"; to make an icon and when the accordion was pressed the icon changed to a diffrent one for the viewer to se something happend. 
  I had a max-width on the panel on the accordion so i wouldn´t streach to much when it´s on desktop view.
  
  I used linear-gradient on the background, buttons, accordion and panels. On the panel i shift the gradien to the opposite on every other one to make them slightly diffrent. 
  
  I used flexbox in the diffrent containers to make nice columns. First container contains the forms and the second container contains the accordion. For the containers i used grid so when the webpage is in mobile view the containers stack on each other and when it´s tablet and desktop view they are beside each other. 
  
  I used the same technic as hero video on top to the footer.
  
  
  If i got more time i would do a log in accordion on the hero video at the top. so when you press the accordion button a form with email, password and submit would show.
  
  My plan was to just start with the sceleton of the form and accordion so i got that right. That was the most importent thing. Then i styled it little by little.
  
  When i got stuck i looked at other sources, like the accordion. Some videos of "who to" did´t not work, because it is hard to put in code in already existing code. But i tried out diffrent once and found a way that worked and understood.
