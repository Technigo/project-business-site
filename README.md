# Business Site

This was a project I did when I attended Technigo Frontend bootcamp. The project was to create a site for a company with a Hero image/video as a header, create some kind of form and a FAQ accordion. Focus was to practice whriting HTML, CSS and get a introduction to Javascript.

## The problem

At first my plan was to use a video as a header but I didnÂ´t get it to even show up in the browser. Because of the lack of time, I used a background image instead.
If I had more time I would of tweeked the design for responsivness and the overall styling of the site.
