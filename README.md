# Business Site

I created a business site for a Snowboard and Ski course. 
The site includes a responsive hero image, a sign up form and a FAQ-Accordion. 
The accordion is created with javascript for toggle between classes and styled as a glasmorphism. 
My sing up form is connectet to httpbin for validation and includes text field, password, email, radio button, checkbox and submit button and styled with css.   

## The problem

My javascript dident go as planned, IÂ´ve solved all the basic functunality first and tried to do more advanced function later. 
To understand the basic requriments of js I had to rename and re-do the code from the lecture and break it down in bits. Which unfortunly makes my name convention really messy and that is something I need to work on. 
I had some issues to get the glass morphism to work before I saw on stackoverflow that you cant set background-color: none but you can use transparent, this helped me alot. 

The images on the site took some time to load which I improved by shrinking them with tinypng.com 

If I had more time I align my flexboxes better, they changes to much in differnt views.
