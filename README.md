# Business Site

Business site with main focus on a hero video, an accordian and a sign up form.


## The problem

Deep-dived into understanding the syntax of js before coding just to minimize the time of debugging.

I divided all sections into different folders in the beginning. Making a separate code for the hero video, the accordian and the sign up form. Just to make sure the functionality is working before getting into styling the whole site. 

When everything worked as I wanted to, I combined all the different folders into one. 

If I had more time, I would be spending time on the layout and making a navbar or a sidebar.
