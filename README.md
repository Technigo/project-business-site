# Business Site

Task was to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus was to practice what we've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

We were working in groups of four or five, using a mob programming approach. Built together with:
David Ballester Font, 
Elin Segelöv, 
Younas Tesfamariam, 
Antonella Cardozo

## The problem

We were struggling with the javascript code but one of our team mates searched for learing material and explained the solution to the rest of us. 
If we had more time we would have cleaned up the code, added more styling and also made the page responsive.
