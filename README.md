# Business Site

This weeks project involved a coding buisness website with a responsive hero-image, it also involved coding simple forms and requests that gave us a quick introduction to Javascript. 

## The problem

I got some problems with the accordion and JavaScript. I started with doing a codealong on YouTube making the accordion with JavaScript and when I still felt like I did not quite understand it I did another one.

For next week I will have to study and read more about JavaScript to get a better understanding.
