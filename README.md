# Business Site

This week I built a Kimchi Workshop website for the project week 3 in Technigo program. The main goal was to practice using background image for the header, making form and accordion and little bit of javascript.

## The problem

I struggled with selecting the right element and class in FAQ accordion in order to make the toggle function in javascript work. In my case I somehow solved it in the end by styling the .active{} class without + ul. I still don't completely understand the logic.  

And I still have problem making the background image for header responsive in mobile version. The width of the header image becomes bit narrower than the size of the screen and I don't know how to solve it.
