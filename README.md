# Business Site

This weeks project was to create a business site which had a hero image/video, a signup form of some sort and a faq accordion. 

## The problem



I started earlier this week with starting this project and i tried to read a code as the days went by. I tried to make realistic goals for myself with not just sying "i will be done today" but adding "i will try to make the hero image a hero video today". I looked at others work on websites and tried to break it. I also did some practice in the website itself but decided to delete it to focus on the things that was assigned. 

I would take it more easy in the beginning. and style it afterwards. I would like more time tho and Need to work on time management more. I still feel quite lost so i would love to have time re-making the previous assignments ðŸ˜€
