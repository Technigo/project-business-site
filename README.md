# Business Site

This project aimed to design a business site that contained a hero video or image, a sign up form with different input-types and checkboxes and an accordion of FAQ. 

## The problem

I planned pretty fast with a rough drawing of my idea but I mainly focused on getting the rough layout up first.
This project was quite smooth, I did however had small issues with the accordion and to make the javascript to work, but after some closer inspection and help from people I discovered that I had written wrong source-code to the script. I also struggled a bit with the responsiveness trying to make it look nice in all views. I reached out to the team for help which was very useful and valueable. I decided to use flexbox for this project since i worked more with grid last time. 
 what would be next would be to make some animation.
