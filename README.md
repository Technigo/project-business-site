# Business Site

This project is a simple template for a business website. The site has to be responsive and should work well with mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

The approach is mobile first to make this project responsive. To make the styling as flexible and scalable as possible, I used CSS variables and also some CSS functions such as calc(), var() and hsl(). This approach helped me to have more control over the design. I used CSS normalize to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
