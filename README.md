# Business Site

This week's project was to create a business site with a form, accordion and hero video/image.

## The problem

I had issues with timemanagement for this project. I am overall not so satisfied with the result and I will come back to this project at another time.

## What i would have dont if i had more time

- Made a Hero image for tablet & mobile view
- Added more attributes to the form
- Styled the accordion more
- Spend more time with the overall design and layout

## View it live
