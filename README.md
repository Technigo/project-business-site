# Business Site

I did a responsive website with hero images that change if it's on desktop, tablet and mobile phone. It also includes a sign-up form and a collapsible accordion made with JS.

## The problem

I think the biggest problem I had was with the icons in the accordion. To make them change back to minus when closing the question through opening another question. But tried my way out and managed to fix it with if statements. There would probably have been an easier way to fix it, but glad I made it work myself! :)
