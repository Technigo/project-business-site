# Business Site

Task was to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus was to practice what we've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

We were working in groups of four or five, using a mob programming approach.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We were struggling with the javascript code but one of our team mates searched for learing material and explained the solution to the rest of us. 
If we had more time we would have cleaned up the code, added more styling and also made the page responsive.
