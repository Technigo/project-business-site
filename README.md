# Business Site

The task for this week was to create a business site with a responsive hero image/video, a signup form with at least three different input types and a FAQ accordion.

## The problem

I struggled A LOT this week. The accordion took me a long time, I tried over and over again to figure out why it didn't work. After asking a question on Stack Overflow it all came down to that I had written a capital H in the JS file and a small h in the HTML file...

I feel that there were many new parts to learn and understand this week and I became very overwhelmed. There are things I'm still not sure how to fix, how to get a label and a checkbox on the same row for example, but I decided to in the end be done with my project and figure these things out later. 

## What I learned
I learned how to make a signup form. I also for the first time made an accordion, however I can't say I feel confident in understanding how the JS code actually works 100%.
