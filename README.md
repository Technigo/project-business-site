# Business Site
This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp. The objective was to learn how to use HTML forms and requests, and a bit of Javascript. The site should include a hero video- or image-header, a signup form, and an accordion. 

I made a site for a fictional business that runs an online yogastudio. 

## The problem
I started by making a sketch over the design. I made a quite simple design with a hero-video for the header (that autoplays and loops, but also has controls), also a backup image that shows if the video can't be seen. I chose the video first and made the design for the entire site to match it. I tried using media queries to change video when the site is on different sized devices (one for mobile, one for tablet and one for desktop), but I found out that Chrome doesnt support media queries with the video-element, you have to use Javascript to succeed. So I will save my other two videos for upcoming projects. In the end I also added a sticky header with navbar. If I had dah more time I would have probably added a hamburger instead of navbar in mobile-sized devices. 

I used flexbox to make the site responsive, so the form and accordion move from row to column when looked at in mobile. 

For the accordion I used the toggle and onclick functions to reveal the answer when clicking on the question. To make every other row pink/blue I used the ":nth-of-type(even/odd)"-selector. I also added icons (+ and -) for the questions, that changes when opened/closed. I had some problems with positioning the icons to the right, and solved it by using "display: block" and "float: right". If I had more time I would make the first answer close when you click on another question. 

For the form I added some validation; the input is pink and changes to blue when correct. That also changed the background color for the submit-button, so I had to make a separate "valid"-styling for that.
