# Business Site

This project involved creating a responsive and visually appealing sign-up page for the one-page "Balanced Body" website. The goal was to design a user-friendly interface that captures user information and preferences, particularly focusing on forms - aligning radio buttons and checkboxes with their respective labels and also to include a header featuring a responsive image or video.

## The problem

The primary challenge was ensuring that form elements, such as radio buttons and checkboxes, were perfectly aligned with their associated labels, both vertically and horizontally. To tackle this problem, I employed a combination of HTML and CSS. I started by mapping out the layout, ensuring that each element was placed logically and aesthetically on the page. The goal was to create a clean, minimalist design that would work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Technologies used: 


HTML5: Structured the content of the sign-up page, ensuring semantic accuracy.


CSS3: Applied styling to ensure the page was visually appealing and that elements such as radio buttons and checkboxes were correctly aligned. Flexbox was used extensively to handle layout tasks, and specific adjustments were made using properties like align-items, justify-content, and transform for fine-tuning.
