# Business Site

The assignment was to create a site for a company or business of our choice.
It had to contain a responsive hero video/image, an accordion and a signup form made with basic JS.

I made a contest for winning a scuba diving trip.

## The problem

I started by planing in which order I was going to start to code as I think it is important to keep a balance between time, learning and level of challenge.

- Hero video/image - I loaded a responsive video but will display a picture if the video can be loaded. I added as well some text and played with opacity and filters to make it easier to read. I added a buttom that will take you to the form to the register.
- The information entered in the form is being submitted to HTTP BIN.
- The accordion is being displayed using basic JS and modifying elements with the DOM. The accordion has a simple toggle function with a smooth transition.
- I decided to challenge myself and learn how to style a checkbox and how to add a "+" and "-" sign to my accordion when showing and hidding information.

I had some issues with the dev tools as it was showing me all of a sudden as if my page wasn't responsive at all. It turned out that my page was working well but it took too long for me to realize that the issue was Live Share or the dev tools cause when I opened my page with a Netlify link it was working well.

I tested the page on Iphone 7/8, Ipad and desktop.
