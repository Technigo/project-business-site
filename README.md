# Business Site

This was the second project of the Technigo Bootcamp. We were to create a website where tcontaining some kind of form to fill out and a f&q section in the shape of an accordion, made using java script.

## The problem
I did not have any particular problems this week. I feel pretty comfortable with flexbox now. My plan was to make it simple as I assumed that the java script would be tricky. It turned out not to be as bad as excpected as we got a lot of guidence in the javascript document. I turned out to have a bit less time to work on the project than I had antisipated, due to workrelated issues. If I would have had more time I would definently have looked deeper into forms.
