# Build a Business Site

Create a site for a company of your choice. You can come up with your own fantasy company or use an existing one. The website should contain a hero image/video, a sign up form and a accordion. 

## The problem
I started with lerning about accordion and form by watching the tutorials. A came up with an idea for the wesite and used figma to create a sketch for the page. I followed a tutorial for creating the accordion and added styling. 
If I had more time I would have started with the mobile first approach, spent more time on styling and added a navbar to the header.
