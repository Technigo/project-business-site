# Business Site - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp. 

Learning objectives:
1. Using image or video in the header, for responsive webpages
2. HTML forms and simple requests
3. Modifying the DOM using Javascript

## Core Tech
- HTML5
- CSS



## Requirements Completed
**🔵 Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**
- Style your page
- Site should have a header with responsive image/video
- Site should have a signup form with at least three different input types
- Site should have an FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript

<!-- **🔴 Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**
- Try out some other form elements or input types. 
- Add an icon before the title in the accordion indicates whether the section is expanded or collapsed. It should update when the section expands or collapses.
- Add some validation to the form
- Use CSS selectors to make every other row in the accordion have another background color, or add a focus effect on the input tags.
- On hover, change the mouse cursor to something other than the default

**⚫ Black Level (Advanced Goals)**
- Add some animations to your project. For example, a slide-down effect when the accordion expands and collapses.
- One of the harder things to do in CSS is to style checkboxes and radio buttons. Try to create custom checkboxes and radio buttons.
- Add a header and/or a button on top of your video, just like Confetti, by using `position: absolute;` and `z-index` to get everything in the right place.
- Read up on the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology and use it for the project -->
