# Business Site

The assiment was to build a business site with a responsive image in the header, signeup form and an accordion. To get to next level I added icon infront of the accordion, stiled it to change color when hover. I added validation to the form. I changed the curser to pointer and text. 

## The problem

I had problems firs to make the accordion work and then to add + and - icons infront of the questions in the accordion. In the end I changed the whole accordion after getting help on Stackoverflow.

If I had more time I would rewrite the code using BEM
