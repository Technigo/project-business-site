# Business Site

The task was to create a business site with a hero picture and/or video, a navbar that sticks ontop when scrolling. Also to create a FAQ-accordion using Javascript. The task was also to create a form with different input tupes, to style the form elements.

I did a mockup site of a small company that rents out cabins in the woods in northern Sweden that targets stressed out city-dwellers, that wants nature-experience but still has high demands when it comes to comfort and a nice concept.

## Tech Used

Html, CSS, Javascript.

## The problem

I built the page from top down. Starting with the header and hero, writing html first and then style with CSS.
On the header I used position fixed to get the header to stick to the top. In the hero I used position relative and absolute and z-index to get it to work having different layers of content.
On the accordion I used a transition to get the accordion text to show in a smoother way. I also made plus/,minus signs and changed them on click using Javascript. Also added different colours on even/odd accordion-items with css.
On the form I added different input types and styled them the best I could. I also put a CSS gradient as a background on the form.

If I would do this again, I would maybe try to use rem more consistently, or not at all. 
It would be fun to make a whole site out of this mockup, and to add pictures and more info and functions to the site.
