# Business Site

The assiment was to build a business site with a responsive image in the header, signeup form and an accordion. To get to next level I added icon infront of the accordion, stiled it to change color when hover. I added validation to the form. I changed the curser to pointer and text. 

## The problem

I had problems firs to make the accordion work and then to add + and - icons infront of the questions in the accordion. In the end I changed the whole accordion after getting help on Stackoverflow.

If I had more time I would rewrite the code using BEM

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
