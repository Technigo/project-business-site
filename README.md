# Business Site

This is an assigment that requeries to build a business site that I made up or a existing one. I choose to make up a Skiing company to build the site that offers skiing lessons. There should be a hero-video, a form and a FQA that is made as an accordion with javaScript. 

## The problem

This is the first time I have used or come in contact with javaScript and that was an challenge in itself. I have been asking my team in slack a lot and asked questions on team session. I asked my first question on Stack Overflow, I also been really sick this week and therefore I have done less then I wanted to achieve and my plan had to change. So this week I have been googling, looking at videos at youtube and asking a lot for help and complaining about being sick ;) hehe 

If I had more time and energy I would have tried to learn more about javaScript and played around with the red and black requirements and used codepen more for practice.
