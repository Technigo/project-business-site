# Business Site

Second Technigo Bootcamp Project. Main focus was to create a working form, an accordion with basic JavaScript and a responsive hero-section.

## The problem

For this project I started off in Figma, creating the design and developing the idea and giving myself time to focus on code when moving on to creating the site. Adding the hero with a video and the form was no problem, as well as a basic accordion. However, I got a bit confused trying to add the ::after-icon, and I ended up just removing the entire accordion and started over. I believe all div-levels got me confused. Using a tutorial on Youtube I succeeded in creating the accordion I wanted in the end.

I was intrigued by the challenge to change appearance of the checkbox and gave it a try. But again I was confused by all levels and decided I'd take on that challenge whenever I'd have more time. If I had more time I'd also put some more effort into adding a few more versions of the video to reduce the filesize for mobile users.
