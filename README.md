I practiced: responsive images, creating a form and accordion 

## The problem

This time I started coding the elements without first making a layout. That took me more time to fix in the end. Next time and from now on I will start with the lay out. I had issues with the image as backgorund image. Some confusion around the requirements of the project but it got clarified. I wanted to be able to target with CSS each image within the <picture> tag. I asked in other forums as well and tried with ID class but it didn't work for me. I was running out of time so chose to use media queries as I did last week. I want to experiment more with this pciture tag and also a responsive video would be next step for me.

In general I focused more in functionality than design.

I did not have big issues with the other tasks. My accordion wasn't working and I couldn't understand why. I asked on StackOverflow and it turned out to be just a (*) misplaced. I got reminded that I should check the console for errors.
