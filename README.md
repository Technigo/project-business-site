# Business Site

Created a bussines one-page website for a fictional dog behaviourist copany called Pawsitive talk.

The main parts of the website are:
- a responsive hero video, 
- a sign up form with validation (text fields, set of radio buttons, email field with validation, submit button) 
- and a FAQ accordion (animated transition). 

## The problem

- I started by finding a header/hero video. 
- Designed a form and decided on componens I want to include.
- Designed accordion with included animation using JavaScript.
- Used flexbox to align elements on the website.

If I had more time:
- make the whole website responsive, not only the video
- I would add animation in accordion buttons + -> -
- styled radio buttons
- animate the hamburger menu in the mobile view
