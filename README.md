# Business Site

A business site featuring: a "hero" image or video, a form containing 3 different input types and an accordion with a toggle function.

## The problem

I wanted my hero to be a video that showed across the whole page, therefore I made it a background using a low z-index value with higher values on the other content. I wanted a simple layout. I used flexbox. The general layout direction is row on small screens and columns on medium and large screens.

I made the mistake of not planning the project thoroughly, and it definitely gave me problems. I had a lot of problems with centering content and making my main containers appear to be the same size. Some of it was due to simple default element styling that took me a long time to find, other problems could have been avoided if I had planned the project in detail. 

If I'd had more time I would have styled the form and accordion to look nicer, and look more professional.
