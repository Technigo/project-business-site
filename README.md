# Business Site
Week 3 project of Hero image/video, Form (Sign up) with validation, Accordion (FAQ) with responsive for Tablet and Desktop, fulfilled 3 level (Blue, Red, Black) requirement.

**🔵  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- Style your page
- Site should have a header with responsive image/video
- Site should have a signup form with at least three different input types
- Site should have an FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript

**🔴  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Try out some other form elements or input types. [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp), you can read about what other form elements there are
- Add an icon before the title in the accordion indicates whether the section is expanded or collapsed. It should update when the section expands or collapses.
- Add some [validation](https://technigo.wistia.com/medias/bvq814g0bk) to the form
- Use CSS selectors to make every other row in the accordion have another background color, or add a focus effect on the input tags. [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) you can check what selectors to use.
- On hover, change the mouse cursor to something other than the default with help from 👉 [MDN Web docs: cursor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor)

**⚫  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Add some animations to your project. For example, a slide-down effect when the accordion expands and collapses.
- One of the harder things to do in CSS is to style checkboxes and radio buttons. Try to create custom [checkboxes](https://www.notion.so/Create-and-style-checkboxes-77dfbec5fa8346978f02db9934f447e8) and [radio buttons](https://www.notion.so/Create-and-style-radio-buttons-0739d9f6b7824c748f78f20e231bdb14).
- Add a header and/or a button on top of your video, just like Confetti, by using `position: absolute;` and `z-index` to get everything in the right place.
- Read up on the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology and use it for the project
