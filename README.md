# Business Site

I made a business site for the Swim baths of Stockholm stad. 

## The problem

I drew a sketch in Figma before I started the work, which made it easier to begin coding – and then I had a clear vision to strive for.

If I had more time I would have focused on the accordian – making an animation with the functionality of hiding the answer to the question I clicked on recently, when choosing to click on a new one. And I would have tryied to customize the radio- and checkbox elements in the form, making the border go away like on the others.
