# Business Site

This weeks assignment was to to create a business one pager website. The focus was on the hero image/video, a sign up form and an accordion.

## The problem

I planned the website by using figma.
If I had more time, I would change the FAQ and the styling around it. I would've wanted to have the questions stay in position when opening each one and adding some more styling. I also would've added a navbar on the top or some kind of logo.
