# Business Site

Created a business landing page that includes a hero image, a signup form, and a FAQ accordion, built with javascript. 

## The project

This project are built with html, css (BEM naming convention) and vanilla javascript. The form includes four different input types: text, telephone, checkbox, and submit. Added icons on the accordion title to indicate whether the section 
is expanded or collapsed. The thing I am most proud of in the project are the form validations which were implemented 
with css and javascript. 

The biggest challenge in this project was to style the checkbox input. If I had more time I would create a custom
checkbox.
