# Business Site

Project 2 in Technigo Bootcamp - a business one-pager site that contain an image/video header, a signup form, and an accordion that can collapse to show and hide text. 

I did a signup site for a fictional community called Garden family. A community of plant-loving people.

## The problem

I started by making a sketch for the site and drew out boxes to illustrate how each element is nested with each other. This time I tried the mobile-first approach with 1 column stack on each other. and later used @meda to do the desktop version. I didn’t want the container to stretch out all the way so I put a max-width to both the form and accordion. Next time I would like to code an indicator that shows the excitement level.
