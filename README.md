# Business Site


Assignment 3 Technigo bootcamp. Build a one-page business site. Practice image backgrounds, HTML forms and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. 


## The problem


I started with designing the site first and then I added animations and function to the accordion, pictures and so on. 
I used Javascript for the first time and tried out some different animations. At first I made functions for each of the pictures separately,
but I realised it would take a lot of time if I wanted to add more pictures later on. I then re-did some of the functions to practice making
them more general. I tried to do the same thing on the CSS since I discovered I could add more than one class to an element and  design them all
with just one class.

If I had more time I would like to add a meny to the navbar on tablet and a drop-down menu on mobile (for now its just an animation/button).
