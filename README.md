# Business Site

Second project was to create a site about our own fantasy company.

## The problem

The site has a hero image with some animations. There is a sign up form composed of various form elements.
Some of the form elements have some basic validation tools based on the input types and attributes.
The accordion for the FAQ is build with Javascript. The site is responsive to different media queries using
flexbox layout.
