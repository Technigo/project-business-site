# Business Site

This project of a Business Site, was made as a Week 3 project for Technigo bootcamp. 

The aim of this project was to create a responsive Business Site and learn how to modify the DOM using Javascript (for adding an FAQ accordion to the website, that will collapse), how to add a responsive hero image and build and style a signup form that would post the data from the form into a HTTPBin service.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

One of the tasks hat was aimed to be achieved - adding an icon after the title in the accordion, indicating whether the section is expanded or collapsed. After trying out different ways of achieving this, on MDN Web documentations I found out, that a ::after selector can be used to achieve this.
