# Business Site

This was my second project on the Technigo bootcamp. The assigment was to create a website including a responsive video header, a form connected to httbin and having a FAQ with a basic accordion using javascript.

# Tech used ðŸ§ 

- Use image or video in the header, for responsive webpages
- How to use HTML forms and simple requests
- How to modify the DOM using Javascript

# Requirements ðŸ§ª

- Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.
- Site should have a header with responsive image/video, a signup form, and a FAQ accordion.
- Contribute by helping others with this project on Stackoverflow.
- If selected; demo your solution for your team.
- Deploy your site, when the code review is done.

# The problem

If I had more time on this project, I would definitely add some animation to the FAQ that shows and hides depending on if the bar is open or not. 

Also another problem I had was that the black bar around the video is displayed on mobile, later I found out that it was actually included in the sample video file.
