# Business Site

I need to build a one-pager business site with a hero image, sign up form, faq accordion using JS. Last week I do not have the chance that add to my project grid, so I did it for this project. 

## The problem

I had a problem with the radio button styling, but I found a youtube tutorial where I undrestood the steps and it worked. If I had more time, I style it more 2020ish.
