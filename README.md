# Business Site

For this weeks project I created a business site that contains a video header, a signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

I started the project by doing a rough sketch on Figma and followed that by doing the layout of the page in VS code, doing all the sections in html. The signup form and accordion were the most time consuming part of this project. I practiced both in Codepen and VS code separately from the project and also saved those drafts for the future. I really struggled, and still do, with Javascript which was needed for the accordion in this project. But with the help of my teammates, I was able to proceed and finish the assignment.
For the future I wish to understand Javascript better because I would've liked to use that more for different functions for this page.
