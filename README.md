# Business Site
This weeks assignment was to bulid a business site including a responsive background image or video. The site also should have a sign up form and an accordion section.

## The problem
I started with drawing a sketch on how I wanted the site to look. When I started coding I did the site structure first and then started to experiment a bit more. I've used a sign up form, an accordion section and a background image that's responsive. This time I didn't make the whole site responsive since I spent quite time to understand and learn sign up form an accordion. If I had more time I would have done the whole site responsive and spent some more time on the accordion design.
