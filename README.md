# Business Site

A business site for a fantasy company including a Hero image, a signup form, and an accordion.


## The problem

*The video is the background in the Hero section.
*The signup form action is set to post to https://httpbin.org/anything so that httpbin will show how this response would look if it was sent to a ser
ver.
*When clicking on the accordion headers a description is shown, and when clicking again the description is hidden.

## View it live

The site is deployed on Netlify (the video could take some time to load)
