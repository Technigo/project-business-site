# Business Site

The task was to buld a buiness site with a responsive hero image/video, a sign up form with a few differnt input types and also an accordion.

## The problem
Styling of the form and accordion was a challange. How to reach for the right element and figure out how to make it like I wanted. It was a lot of trial and error and a lot of ctrl+k+c to figure out what the code does and what domioeffect it has. 

I had some problems with how the site looked in mobile view, and especially iphone, when I published the site. My herotext was off, the textfields in the form did not fit right and on iphone the icons was stretched. The iphone-issue was a surprise and a really useful experience. 

If I had more time I would have: -styled it a bit more -added a hamburgermenu for mobileview -added validation for the form, tried some more input forms -added icon to show if the accordion is expanded or collapsed -added another media querie and more adjustment to them -addes some pictures with testimonials from crossfit members.
