# Business Site

A business one pager website with a hero image, signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

I started with the hero image and the basic html layout. Then I set up the JavaScript file and and added CSS styling for the signup form and the accordion. This week I learned a bit more advanced CSS (pseudo class selectors and combinator selectors) and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. If I had more time I would create a header and/or footer, style the checkbox and perhaps change the hero image for a video in the Padlet and Desktop version.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
