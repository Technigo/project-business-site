# Business Site

I created a sign up page that looks similar to mentimeter.com/signup

## The problem

I think its a challenge to create a nice looking design. 
I worked a bit on the width for the business-form and the accordion. Initially on mobile they took up the entire width. I decided to give them some space. 
I initially used the picture tag but moved over to background-image. I used three different sizes to keep it responsive. I also put a logotype on top of the background image which I think worked out nice.
