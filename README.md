# Business Site

With this project we were supposed to do a single page with a form submit and a FAQ accordion. Doing it mostly in HTML and CSS to find a presentable structure, and of course responsive across different device widths. Some JavaScript was used for the animation of the accordion.

## The problem

First I tried to get a grasp of how I wanted to structure the site. I wanted to have the same first experience or view despite the device you enter the site on, so a splash, including a dramatic background, was made and within it I set up a simple grid for the different headlines to work with responsiveness. Underneath an ingress to bridge the gap between splash and form/FAQ.

The form and FAQ boxes were made with flexbox and simply wrap down vertically on narrower devices. Relatively easy HTML to be honest, although I did spend -err, waste, a lot of time trying to style the form buttons and whatnot; ended up scraping it completely as it got a unneccessarily complex ('proper' styling support seems to be lacking). That was a good lesson to learn.

However, to make the accordion work properly was a bit brutal as JavaScript was needed. I ended up being heavily inspired by a W3Schools example. I need to do a few more of these to really wrap my head around them, but it ended up working really well. Just the way I expected it to and would've liked to nave seen myself as a visitor.

Sadly, life got in the way during the week so I spent less time than I would've wanted. To really dive deep into certain things such as the form styling or the JavaScript. Had more time been on my hands I would've definitely spent that getting the form a little bit more in tune with the rest of the site, and of course fleshed the texts out with something a bit more ...meaningful. And given the overall UI a bit more polish.

Despite all of that I ended up being quite happy with the result. Enjoy :)
