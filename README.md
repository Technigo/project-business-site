# Business Site

This is a business site for the Technigo course intro to javaScript.

## The problem

Create a sign-up form, accordion and a hero header.  
I used flexbox to lay out the components and Html for the user to fill in the form correct. 
The accordion does toggle with getElementbyId.
The hero-header is a img set to cover as a background.
