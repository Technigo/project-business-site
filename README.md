# Business Site

The mission was to do a responsive business-site with a hero-header, a form and a accordion. I did the website with some content from my own company.

## The problem

In this project I decided to use only grid but ended up thinking that grid and flexbox complement eachother more then being exclusive.

I had some issues with the grid on the accordion since I didnt take into consideration that the answers also is a part of the grid.

I tried to use the BEM-method to name the classes.
