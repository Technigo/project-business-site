# Business Site

Our task was to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus was for us to practice what we've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. 

We had to work in groups of four or five, using a mob programming approach.
