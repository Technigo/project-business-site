# Business Site

Project making a Business Site, fantasy site built with a 'Hero' video, signup form, accordion with small bit of JavaScript.

## The problem

Started finding a hero video I liked from pexels.com for the 'hero', a lavender field, then after a while my site was about lavender and everything got the color purple.
Used the sketch pictures included for inspiration for the layout.
Did mobile first and used the skills I got to learn from last project and added the new requirements.
Used the included JS script with the project for the accordion.
Connected it to httpbin.org with method="POST", for some feedback on the signup forms. Made some inputs required.
Did a glow animation for top text, but it seems a bit 'slow'.

If I had more time I would've like to style it more, especially radio/checkboxes. Make some things smoother here and there, like the accordion. Was a bit pressed for time this week. Probably could clean up the code better as well.
