# Business Site
This project was made by me on my 3rd week of the Technigo bootcamp. 
We were supposed to create a businees page that should contain a image as a header, a signup form and an accordation. The focus was to practice what we had learned about image background, HTML forms and how to modify the DOM with Javascript.


## The problem

At this point I was still struggeling on how to make my site responsive, I wanted to make my flexdirection into a column. 
I also struggled to make my answer and question to fit into the boxes, since they didnt I had to change the size of the box for form and accordation.
