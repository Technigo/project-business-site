# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site with three main components; a hero image/video top section, a signup form and an accordion. The signup form was to contain information fields that can be filled out and when submitted posted to httpbin. The accordion was to consist of titel sections with an expandable and collapsible text field below each one. 

## The problem

I built one section at the time and worked with the layout and look inbetween. Last week I liked working with the width percentage, because of the responsiveness it gives, and this week I learned how to work with height percentage too, which is a bit trickier. I used Flexbox for managing the layout. In the beginning I wanted to use a video for the top section but I didn’t manage to get it to work so I dropped it and went with an image instead. The page feels complete as it is but if I would have had more time I would have investigated further how come the video wasn’t working. 

UPDATE! I managed to add a video element with an overlay effect for the header. The overlay effect was added to make the video blend in better with the color scheme established with the provoius header image and because it's a nice effect. Height percentages wasn't working with video for me, so dropped that, but it looks good without it I think and I'm glad I learned to work with it even if its not in the final product.
