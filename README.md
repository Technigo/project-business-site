## Tranquil Essence Spa - Business One-Pager

This project is a responsive one-page website for a fictional business, "Tranquil Essence Spa," designed to showcase HTML forms and responsive design principles.

## The Problem

The task was to create a responsive one-page business website with a video header and a signup form that includes various input types.

## Approach

I started by planning the structure of the website, focusing on the header and form layout. I used HTML5 for the structure, ensuring semantic and clean code. CSS3 was used for styling, with a focus on responsive design to make sure the site looks good on all devices. I also implemented a fallback image for mobile devices and applied media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
