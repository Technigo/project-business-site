# salsamigos

This is a website for a fantasy company that helps people find salsa partners in their town. 

The site was made to practice forms, basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript, accordions and responsive hero videos.

## Features

* Responsive for all devices
* Header with background video and overlay
* Sign-up form with DOM manipulation 
* FAQ with accordion 
* BEM Methodolody 

## Production process

* A simple design for the mobile and desktop versions was sketched on paper first. 
* I first proceeded to build the mobile version, and then adapted certain responsiveness details to tablets and desktops. 
* The site is mostly built with HTML and CSS. I used Javascript for only two purposes: Toggling accordion sections through a toggle function, and jumping to different sections of the page through an onclick event on the navbar links. 
* I used flexbox for most of the page layout, in places like the sign-up form or the sponsors section. 

## Future implementations
* Nicer styling on the FAQ and Sign-Up Form (softer shapes, maybe more colors) 
* Hover effects
* Further input types or form elements
* Form validation
