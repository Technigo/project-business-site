# Business Site

Making a business website that contains a form with different user inputs and an interactive accordion with FAQ's using some JavaScript.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Started out with the shell of my soon-to-be form with the thought of someone making an order through user inputs. In this case; order buns. Made some text inputs combined with radio to chose what kind of bun, checkboxes for potential allergies and a number box for quantity before hitting the botton and placing an order. Using placeholders to reassure the site visitor of what's requesten in that input. Getting a green thumbs up when the input in considered valid.

Wrapped the form in flexbox to have it side by side with the FAQ. Went on the show the answers and making sure they're going to be aligned with the questions and then hid them again. Working with transitioning through max-height as a height is needed for something to 'grow' in this case. The answer-sections got a max-height of 0 and will grow to 150px when active - during a transition of 0.4s. Took a while to know where to place the exact location of the transformation and getting it to work, both ways. A lot of Google, trying it out and w3school to help sort out my code and getting these details to work.

Kept the styling light and neat with a café au lait type of theme. Reached some stretch goals such as nth:child with the questions and made the middle section a bit darker. Let the input focus to change bakground and not have that blue highlighter around. Played around with the cursor and styled it different depending on where you hover. The submit button and question "boxes" will also pop up a bit when hover. Finished off with a small footer containing contact information and links on both phone image and number - which will make a potential phone call if clicking.

If I had more time and energy this week I would have spent it exploring more of the JavaScript elements and maybe create some type of form validtors. Trying to get the transition to work smoothly took a lot of time but was definitly worth the work which I'm super proud of!
