# Business Site

This is my third project for the Technigo boot camp where I designed a business site that has a signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

The problems I had was mostlu with the validation where i wanted the input to show a red border when it's invalid, but the red border shows up when you refresh the page, since I guess that the inputs are invalid from the start. I didn't like the look of it and desided to not do som CSS design with the validation. I also had problems with my videobackground who wasn't fully taking up the whole page, but I solved with help from the townhall meeting and by changing the height to 100vw!

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
