# Business Site
This weekâ€™s project was to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus was to practice what we've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem
I have probably struggled the most with the layout this week, epecially regarding the responsiveness. I've also struggled a bit with the form and to get the accordion going with the updated icon.. but I kind of got it :)


## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
