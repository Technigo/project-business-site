# Business Site
My business site is a site where you can buy custommade knitted sweaters. 

## The problem
I used flexbox to arrange, which is something I've found difficult earlier. But hopefully it worked fine. I new what things I wanted to have but I started with the image and went from there when choosing the colorscheme. 
What helped me a lot was google as always, but also friends from class. I looked at their code if I didn't understand something and tried to understand how things worked. 

If I had more time I'd try to make the accordion a little bit bigger, and maybe not use buttons. I'd also like to learn how to make input fields responsive and how to align them better.
