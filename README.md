# Business Site

This project was about to create a business site with an accordion and a responsive hero image or video.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

The biggest problem this week was the accordion, i did not get it to expand. Found no error in the code and had to spend a lot of time troubleshooting.
Another difficulty was getting rid of margins around hero video and hub bars.

I found some helpful youtube guides about accordion and hero video that I used.

I I had more time I would try to style checkboxes and radio buttons.
