# Business Site

This weeks project was to create a business site. The site should contain a top section with a responsive background image or video, sign up form and an accordion with collapsable text.

## The problem

For this weeks project I really enjoyed learning how to create forms and how to apply some basic JavaScript to the accordion. I struggled a bit with the design and planning.

For the future I will try to stress less, practice on doing simple sketches on paper and try to focus on the right things â€“ such as the structure and functions of the website.
