# Business Site

The assignement was to build a business website with a hero image or video, a signup form and an accordion. I chose to build a site for a business that sends out a weekly newsletter about plants. 



## The problem

I chose to approach each task separately, starting with the header with the hero video background. I then moved on to the signup form which I made using the forms tag and styled with the help of flexbox. Finally, I built the accordion FAQ. I had problems making the accordion work, so I found a slightly differentt toggle function which worked well. When that was done, I decided I wanted to build a navbar that appeared after scrolling, and found a tutorial on how to do that using onscroll in javascript.
