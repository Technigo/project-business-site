# Bussiness Site

A responsive site with a little touch of JavaScript. This site is built with components such as a video header, HTML forms, and an accordion Q&A section. I built a site where you can book your dream vacation.

# What I learned

- How to create HTML forms 
- How to manipulate with video tag in HTML 
- How to create an accordion section using JavaScipt 
- For this project, I started with desktop screen styling and learned how to use media queries.
