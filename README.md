# Business Site

This was our second project at Technigo bootcamp. The assignment was to make a "business site" including a header with responsive image/video, a signup form, and a FAQ accordion. For the FAQ accordion we used JavaScript for the first time. 

I was happy to be able to use flexbox and some other tools that we tried on earlier and that I fully understand what I was doing this time. The JavaScript is not really there yet. It works but I havent really understood how it works yet. That was my biggest struggle.

Im satisfied with the design and how the site turned out and that I had time for some of the stretch goals. 
If I had some more time I would probably tried to use video instead of an image in the head.
