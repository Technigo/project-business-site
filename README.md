# Project: Business Site

Create a site for a company of your choice. You can come up with your own fantasy company or use an existing one. We want you to practice what we've gone through this week so the website should contain these three parts: hero image/video, signup form and accordion.

My page t’s called Sprinkle. It’s a community where you as a developer can share your knowledge with students in a more intimate way. Sprinkle your knowledge!

## How did I do it?
I decided to use CSS Grids for the layout. The CSS grid is divided in 12 fraction so it’s easy to divide the page in columns.

What I learned:
* This week I touched JS for the first time. Even if it was the most simple code - for me it’s was a struggle to understand it. But I know in time - I will get it :) 

* To design a sign up form and accordion was really fun and I learned so much while doing it. With inputs, submitted to HTTP BIN, toggle in JS, the Dom and so on. That was all new to me! 

* Via Technigos super duper good tutorials I did customised radio- and check buttons. 🎉

When I hit a dead end or a problem
When a problem arose, I either googled, used dev-tools or asked my husband (he is a back-end developer). This week I had less time to sit with the project but when I had the time I tried to be really effective.

My own reflection
I wish I had more time so I could read more of the deep-dive material. Sometimes I get so stressed that I just want to finish the project so I forget some other pieces (like reading some of the material). But when I get the hang of it all more - I will go back and read everything in quiet. 👩‍💻
