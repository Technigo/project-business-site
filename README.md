# Business Site

This project is about making a businesssite with a sign-up form and a FAQ accordion (where the answer opens up when a question is clicked with help of JavaScript) and also to use a hero image or video in the header that is responsive. 

I created a businesssite for a wine company. 

## The problem

I started to sketch the site for mobile, tablet and desktop in Miro.com and wanted the form and FAQ to be similiar. Then I used background-img property in CSS for the responsive hero image and played around with its properties to make the hero image responsive. If I had more time I would have added some validations to the forms and added styling to validations. I would have also made a functioning hamburger menu for mobile. I would have also put more time or design and functionality for the different input types and added more hover and click effects.
