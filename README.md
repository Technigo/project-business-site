## Business News Site

Second project at Technigo Bootcamp
Project time: 1 week.

I was building a “booking request form” for my dream business - a cold bathing spa. The assignment was to build a business site with a responsive image/video. And add a signup form and have a FAQ accordion (built with JavaScript). 

## The problem
I have practiced my flexbox skills from last week's assignment, so that my form would behave as I wanted it to behave. I tried mobile first as an approach for the layout, and it felt really good. I am really excited about what JavaScript can do and want to explore that more if I hade more time.
