# Business Site

I have created here a website for watersports experiences.
It contains a Form, Responsive hero video and accordian and use of z-Index to layer on the site.

## The problem

I faced problems with the accordion because of my lack of knowledge in JS. Which I am currently working on. But I did finally have it working. Also the video does work in the desktop view. I am currently researching exactly what format / resolutions are best to use.
