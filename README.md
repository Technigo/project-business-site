# Business Site

This was the second project on the Technigo boot camp. The assignment was to create a site for a company. The site should contain a responsive video or image header, a form, and an accordion.

## The problem

I started by adding all the elements that should be included. I then started styling the elements, starting from the top of the HTML file. I redid my hero header a number of times, trying out both images and videos. When my header was done I went on with the accordion. I managed to get it working by using the JavaScript function in the repo. After the code session I redid the accordion and used the more advanced generic JavaScript function. I even managed to add to the function, so that the plus/minus signs toggled when opening and closing the accordion. I then went on with the form, going through the same indecisive styling process again and trying out a number of styles before I settled on something. I added custom radio buttons and checkboxes. I really struggled with finding a cohesive style for my site, as I always do. I still haven't figured out a solution, but I tried a different approach this week by starting by adding all elements and then add the style. I'm not sure it was a great success though.

Beside the styling I also put a lot of effort into trying to slim down the code and making it as generic and reusable as possible. 

If i had more time I would have liked to add more CSS finesse to the page. I would also have liked to add some more JavaScript functions, like a pop up when the form was submitted, and to use the BEM methodology. I'm really into structure and organising the code.
