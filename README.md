# Business Site

This weekâ€™s project is to create a business website that contains an image/video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus is to practice what I've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

I created a Dance Academy website.

## The problem


I started by drawing sketches on paper. After figuring out how to start with the first html structure, I progressed by adding CSS styles in the same breath.

Adding a hero video, form, and a basic accordion wasn't difficult for me. To challenge myself, I wanted to go a little further and created a hero video slider. There are many ways to create a video slider with JS but for this stage I prefered to go with pure CSS.

I always aim to try something new and go beyond the requirements so I'm satisfied with what I`ve accomplished this week.

If I had more time I would probably try more JS functions. Because now it's just a small touch of Javascript.
