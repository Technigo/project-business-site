# Business Site

This was the third week assignment for technigo bootcamp. 
Yhe task was to create a business website with Q&A and a form.

## The problem
Unfortunately this week I had very little time to do the assignement. Therefore i did a plan just to manage the minimum requirements and always sticking to that backlog. 

Techniques:
DOM
flexbox
picture tag 

If I had more time: 
* Make the function that the question expands more clear. For example with (+/-). 
Also adding so conditional styleling to the questions and answers.
* Structure the code better
* Also try different was to write the code in js. (Now I only found a solution and stick to it, I think is better ways to write more clean code.
