# Business Site

This week's project was about creating a business site with a submit form and an accordion with an FAQ. 

## The problem

I started out by creating the layout and moved on to focusing on the alignment of the elements. I put a lot of effort in making the code look clean and organized, as well as thinking about naming conventions and avoiding unnecessary line breaks. (All of these I received feedback on in last weeks project) 
I added the video in the hero section last, and if i had more time i'd put more effort into the color-choosing and the fonts.

I first interpreted the validation-goal as js-validation, so I have some code in my js-file for that. After realizing the assignment was about validation in the html, I added that. The JS-code remains in the project.
