This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp.

# Business Site
 The objective was to learn how to use HTML forms and requests, and a bit of Javascript. The site should include a hero video- or image-header, a signup form, and an accordion. 

I made a site for a fictional business that runs an online yogastudio. 

I used flexbox to make the site responsive, so the form and accordion move from row to column when looked at in mobile. For the accordion I used the toggle and onclick functions to reveal the answer when clicking on the question. For the form I added some validation; the input is pink and changes to blue when correct.
