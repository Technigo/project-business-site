# Business Site

This Business Site has been developed as a bootcamp project and served to practice forms in HTML and to style them with CSS. The requirements included a header with a hero part, different kinds of input types, and the page should be fully responsive.

## The problem

I have been using figma for my first scatch and got inspired by  forms I could find online.
In a next step it would be important to make the form fully accessible.
