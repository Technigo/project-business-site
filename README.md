 -Ticketservice-site for the festival Amnesia Ibiza-

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. If you had more time, what would be next?

-Used BEM-structure for the header- blocks, element and modifier.

-For the layout I used Grid and flexbox(the site is responsive). 

-I implemented a video and a header to the hero-section and used position: fixed and z-index to make the elements stay in the background while the user scrolling up/down. I allso imported a song with a audio-tag. I used the same attributes(muted, autoplay, loop) for the video and audio.

-To hand in information from customers I implemented inputs-forms(name, lastname, mailadress ect), radio-buttons(ticket information) and checkboxes(newsletter and age validation). I used to diffrent ways to style the radio-button(custom styling) and the checkboxes(change color on the default checkbox). 

-I build a accordion (FAQ) whit javascript and css to implement expand/collapse sections. I added animations for a smoother slide up/down-effect, cursors & icons(w/two variations due to expanded/collapsedmode). 

The hardest task this week was the custom styling on the radio-button > If I had more time I would build a musicplayer using javascript!
