# Business Site

Project for Technigo week 3: The Business Site, fantasy site built with a 'Hero' video, signup form, accordion with small bit of JavaScript.

## The problem

Started finding a hero video I liked from pexels.com for the 'hero', a lavender field, then after a while my site was about lavender and everything got the color purple.
Used the sketch pictures included for inspiration for the layout.
Did mobile first and used the skills I got to learn from last project and added the new requirements.
Watched the course material and some online tutorials to get a grip of forms and accordion, then tried to implement it on the site as good as I could.
Used the included JS script with the project for the accordion.
Connected it to httpbin.org with method="POST", for some feedback on the signup forms. Made some inputs required.
Did a glow animation for top text, but it seems a bit 'slow'.

If I had more time I would've like to style it more. Make some things smoother here and there. Was a bit pressed for time this week. Probably could clean up the code better as well.
Tried to make the hero video responsive In diffrent ways for loading diffrent quality for certains widths, but don't know if it got to work as intended.
