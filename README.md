# Business Site

The task was to create a business site with a hero picture and/or video, a navbar that sticks ontop when crolling. Also to create a FAQ-accordion using Javascript. The task was also to create a form with different input tupes, to style the form elements.

I did a mockup site of a small company that rents out cabins in the woods in northern Sweden that targets stressed out city-dwellers, that wants nature-experience but still has high demands when it comes to comfort and a nice concept.

## The problem
I tried to buld the page from top down. Starting with the header and hero, writing html first and then style with CSS.
I found this task overall quite challenging. There was a lot of new information to take in in a short time. I also changed the layout a few times which took time. I would say I'm happy with the end result after putting in a lot of work into this project.
I had some issues trying to get the picture tag to work, and styling the form was a bit tricky also. I also had some horizontal scroll that took a while to figure out why, but fixed it eventually. It was also a challenge to understand the Javascript-bit and how to write the js-code.

On the header I used position fixed to get the header to stick to the top. In the hero I used position relative and absolute and z-index to get it to work having different layers of content.

On the accordion I used a transition to get the accordion text to show in a smoother way. I also made plus/,minus signs and changed them on click using Javascript. Also added different colours on even/odd accordion-items with css.

On the form I added different input types and styled them the best I could. 

I also tried to use rem-units instead of pixels, but found it a bit tricky.

If I would do this again, I would maybe try to use rem more consistently, or not att all. Also I would not spend so much time trying to get the site to look pretty. as I think this stole some valuable time for me on this project.
It would be fun though to make a whole site out of this mockup, and to add pictures and more info and functions to the site.
