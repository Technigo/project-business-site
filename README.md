## Business Site

Create a business one-pager website. The main focus is on HTML Forms.
There should be a header with a picture or video, a form with three different input types and the site should be responsive.

## The problem

We planned the project by sketching out the website on Figma. We used flexbox and media queries to solve the problem and get the results we wanted.

If we had more time, we would insert some videos and make the background fancier.
