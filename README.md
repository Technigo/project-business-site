# Business Site
I've created a business one-pager website that contains a hero header, a form and responsive design.

## The problem
I used flexbox to place the content and make the design responsive. I made a form with different input types. For my future projects I want to keep exploring both flexbox and css grid. And I also want to try making different types of forms. When I made this site I coded the html first from top to bottom and then I styled it with CSS, starting with the smalest version (mobile first).
