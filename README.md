# Business Site

When it comes to special events, flowers are usually ordered a couple of weeks prior from one of the auction hauses around the world. This year in particular, due to the amount of canceled events, flower shops are struggling to help their businesses survive. Bloomista Flowers is a mock-up business idea delivering freshest, most beautiful flower arrangements at a fraction of a cost in order to help save the flower industry from both waste and lost capital. Anyone can make deliveries - just like any other carpooling service, a driver would pick up and deliver the flower arrangement to the customer.

## The problem

Combining flexboxes and some vanilla JS, I created a responsive sign-up form which prompts the user with messages in case they have forgotten to enter first name, last name, email address. Next to the sign-up form, there is a simple yet responsive FAQ sheeth and a clean and slightly embelished footer. Since there are only 3 links in the navbar, i opted out of the hamburger menu option and decided to keep it as is.
