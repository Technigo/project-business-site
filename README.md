# Business Site

Our first project at Technigo bootcamp during the introdays.The assignment was to create a business-site containing a header with a hero-image, a input form that should be possible to submit and a Q&A that could show & hide answers of questions.

## The problem

The big challange in this project was the short period of time and using mob-programing when all of us were new to coding. It was a fun challange and I'm happy what we managed to do in such a short time.
