# Business Site
Build a buisness site with a Hero image/video hero, form and accordion.

## The problem

First I made a quick sketch on how I wanted the website to look. Then I made a hero image header, which was quite easy. Then I made a form, which i styled a bit and then I made the accordion. The only thing I had a hard time with understanding was the accordion but after a codealong with our teacher everything fell in to place and it was super easy.
