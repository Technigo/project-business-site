# Business Site

A business site featuring: a "hero" image or video, a form containing 3 different input types and an accordion with a toggle function.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I wanted my hero to be a video that showed across the whole page, so I made it a background using a low z-index value with higher values on the other content. I wanted my layout to be very simple. I used flexbox for the content. The general layout is row on small screens and columns on medium and large screens.

I'm pretty happy with my project but if I'd had more time I would have styled the form and accordion to look nicer.
