# Business Site

The task was to create a business website.

The specific requireents included having a hero section with picture or video and site name on top of the picture, a form with minimum of 4 different types of input, and a FAQ section with collapsable Q&A.

## The problem

To solve the tasks I have used the following tools:

a. a picture tag with different formats for different scree sizes to create a responsive hero image; different positioning and styling of the text to make sure it is visible on top of the picture

b. form tag to create a form with various inputs. The inputs included input type text, email, password, radio buttons, date, selector, ceckboxes and submit button. I have also created custom styling for each element to match the color-combination of the website. 

c. to create collapsable accordion I used JavaScript methods querySelectorAll and forEach, as well as an if statement.

d. to allign all elements of the webpage and ensure responsive design I used Flexbox. Also I used media queries to make sure that the webpage looks good on all screen types.
