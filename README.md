# Business Site
The purpose of this weeks's project was to create a business site that had a responsive hero image/video, a html sign up- form and an accordion made with javascript. 

## The problem
- Hero image/video
- I wanted to do a video for desktop and images for smaller devices. I used the picture tag with two media queries for mobile and desktop and used display:none for the desktop version and then added a video tag instead. I added the z-index property with a -1 value to the video tag to show the text on top of the video.

- Form
- I tried out different approaches for the form and started with a Ul-list, but then ended up with a more simple structure with div:s instead. I struggled a lot with aligning my customized radio-buttons to the rest of the form. I tried to many solutions at once, with flexbox and position-alternatives, but got help from Stackoverflow with removing the postion properties and then adding flexbox to my radio-button container.
I started out with a fieldset and a legend but had some issues with making them fit inside the boxes that had a fixed width. I removed them for this time, but will work on that for future projects. 

- Accordion
- Anna Hasselstr√∂m in the hippo-team shared a youtube tutorial that really helped a lot when making the accordion. I used it step by step and then adjusted it a bit to my page and took the time to understand the javascript I implemented on my site.

If I had more time I would have:

- added a button to my hero image/video.
- added some hover-effects on the accordion.
- tried to make a responsive video.
- worked on finding a way to make the accordian stay inside of it's container when it expands.
