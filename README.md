# Business Site

This website page displays a form and an accordion, using a bit of JavaScript.

## The problem

I did not managed to set the hero video as a header. Instead, it is displayed as a top section. If I would have more time, I would have set the navbar on top of it and set it in a fixed position when scrolling down. Next time, I'll try to display the form and accordion side by side and not on top of each other.
