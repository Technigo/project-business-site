# Business Site
This weekâ€™s project was to create a site for a company of my choice. The site had to include a sign up form and a javascript accordion with FAQ's. 

## The problem
In this project I've done a business website with a hero picture (I chose to do a hero video instead), sign up form and an accordion. I have used Javascript for the accordion and added a plus and minus for when the accordion is expand / not expand. I styled the page in css. 
The form had to include 
- 2 x Text fields
- 1 x A password field
- 1 x Set of radio buttons
- 1 x Set of checkboxes
- 1 x Submit button
and then we used method Post to send the answers to HttpBin.
