# Business Site

we had to create a one page bussines website that contains a header, a Signup form and a submit button, the web site has to be styled and it must to be fully responsive

## The problem


The main problem for me was the form, style it was very tricky, and I had to research a lot using mostly chatgpt, w3school and stackoverflow. Despite I could mostly solve it, I'm still not 100% happy with it, because my main idea was to have an image horizontly in the left side and pairing it with the form to the right side. But when I was trying to add the image the form was losing its properties, at the end I decided to keep only the form, but I couldn't center it so I had to keep the form to the left side, leading an empty space in the right side of the website, if I had more time, I would want to fix this.

Another problem was upploading the hero video, I needed to increase the buffer size something I learned on stackoverflow.
