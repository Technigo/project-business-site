# Business Site

This project is part of the Technigo bootcamp autumn 2021, the goal was to learn about forms, form validation, responsive design and an introduction to javascript. Harvest the Sun is a business site built to alow registration to a webinar.

## The problem

I began building the responsivness of the site based on a template in the Technigo master branch for this I used flexbox. Then added some basic styling and finally javascript for the dynamic accordion.

The site is build with HTML, CSS, JS with a mobile first approch, then tablet and desktop. It is divided in 3 secitons on the top there is a hero video, then underneath a form and finally an accordion with an faq.

The part I'm most proud of is the accordion and javascrip dynamics
