# Business Site

In this assignment, I was asked to create a business site with a hero picture/video and a sign up form. I chose to make a fictitious music streaming service (like Spotify) called Stellar Sound.

## The problem

How I Approached the Problem:

To solve the problem, I started by carefully analyzing the requirements and breaking them down into smaller tasks. I created a plan on paper that outlined each step I needed to take, from setting up the basic structure to integrating key features. I also inspected other websites (such as Confetti and Spotify) to see where and when they had used different HTML tags.

Tools and Techniques I Used:

I used HTML and CSS to develop the website. My approach involved using both Grid and Flexbox in CSS to ensure that the site was both user-friendly and responsive. I also used Media Queries to make it look good on diffrent devices. This time, I only used Media Queries to make the website look good on mobile phones, as I felt the website worked just as well on desktop screens as on tablets.

Planning Process:

I began by sketching the layout and features of the site on paper. Once the structure was clear, I moved on to designing the look and planning how to structure the code, with a focus on core functionality first. By continuously testing in VS Code and checking the results in the browser, I was able to improve functionality and refine the design.

What I Would Do Next If I Had More Time:

With more time, I would focus on enhancing the user experience by adding more interactive elements and further refining the design. I would also explore the possibility of adding a validation to my password element saying "min 8 characters". One thing I couldn't achieve was using flexbox in mobile size to ensure that the list items in the <footer> were arranged with two items per row. In other words, I wanted it to look like this:

and not:

Maybe you have a suggestion how to solve this? :-D
