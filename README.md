# Business Site

This weeks project contains three vital parts
 - A hero image / video with responsive properties, for example by making use of the picture tag
 - A form that actually collects and sends data
 - An accordion making use of our first lines of JavaScript.

## The problem

Create a business site containing all three parts, make it responsive and add som detalils.

I continued last weeks exersises and made use of flexbbox again to structure and layout mu site. I knew from the start that I wanted to have my form as part (inbedded) in my hero section and used the bakground image option and used a gif instead of either a img or video. 
Since I don't own my artwork this was a bit problematic but I mede sure to implement the functionality all though the source is the same troughout.
