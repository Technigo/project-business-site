# Business Site

Build a Business site with a Hero Banner, a Form with input fields and an Accordion FAQ section built with JavaScript 


## The problem

For this weeks project i feel that i was more in line with planning first and then step by step doing the hero, the form and then the accoridon. I listened to Maks about first getting the structure and the JavaScript in place to later on add the CSS. 

For the Hero at first i had some troubles with getting it repsonsive. Or actually, there was no problem, i did just not see that the responsive feature was there. So i got some wonderful help from Stackoverflow.

For styling my form i googled alot! I hade som issues with my autofill messing upp my CSS once i clicked autofill. But i found some answer on how to style the input of the form eventho i choosed autofill. 

i would have liked to spend more time on learning more about styling the Checkbox button. I had som issues getting it bigger. Also styling the form overall. 

For the Accordion i feel happy about it. I now not much JavaScript yet and i tried to add the collapse funtion and also a symbol for opening and closing the answers, but i did not have the time management for this on my side.
