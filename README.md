        ∘ A password field
        ∘ Set of radio buttons
        ∘ Set of checkboxes
        ∘ Submit button
•   Style your page

## The problem

OBS! The hamburger menu (navbar-burger) bar is visible on all size of screens this time because i do not have enough time to fix the display for navbar menu. I will fix it later.

BTW my java script does not work as well this time, nor in last project. I also need time to fix this. So the button of "Pause" do NOT work at all...

<!-- IF you happened to review the first version plz do not mind the comment everywhere I left in the coding !!! -->
<!-- I will clean and dry html and css in the second version soon. Promise! :)  -->
