# Business Site

Building a one-page website with a form. We built a site for starting a gym membership.  

## The problem

We started in Figjam to make a sketch. We then used mobprogramming to start building the site, starting with HTML. We used live share and live server to create together. If we had more time we would try to advance the design of the page more.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
