## Project 2: Business website for a coffee shop

This is a Coffee shop webpage with a video header for desktop and responsive images for tablet/mobile. It has a sign up form and an accordion with questions/answers made with Javascript.

## Focus
To practice using image backgrounds, video as a header, HTML forms, Javascript accordion and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

## The process

* I visualized my website in 3 resolutions(mobile,tablet,desktop) in Figma
* I used flexbox to align elements in the main section
* Styled the sign up form with CSS 
* Created the accordion with Javascript and added some CSS styling to it

## Challenges to solve
Create a sticky navbar and add a favicon.
