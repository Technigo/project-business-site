# Business Site

For this assignment, I decided to create a one-page website for a tennis training business. The site contains a hero header/image, a contact form, and the site is responsive.

## The problem
When I first developed the page I found it challenging to adapt it from desktop to mobile. So I decided to start over and build the site with a mobile-first approach. Afterwards I used mediaqueries to make sure that the layout worked well on larger screens like iPads and desktops. I struggled quite a bit with the hero image, figuring out how to style it in CSS so it looked good on all devices, which took a lot of time. Despite the challenges it was a fun learning experience and from now on I feel that I will likely stick with the mobile-first approach moving forward.
