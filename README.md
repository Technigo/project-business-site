My business is information based and working with organization to save the ocean. FAQ it's a way to get to know the company and sign up to be a part of the clean water Generation community.

## The problem

This project did go more smoothy than the first. 

But struggled little bit with the accordion to get it how I wanted it. I solved it with google, with the videos on canvas and the codepen help a lot. 

I also struggled litte bit with the checkbox, I got the solution from team, they help me a lot. 

I think I planned good this time and looks almost like a wanted. So I will keep up the good work.
