# Business Site

In this project, I focused on building a reponsive website and implementing vanilla Javascript to my accordion, responsive navigation bar, and custom alert box (after user submitted the form).


## The problem

The orginal goal was to build an interactive accordion. However, I wanted to challenge myself by adding the automatic closing function. That means only one answer box can be openned at a time. And I managed to solve it succesfully and learned a lot about how and when to use if/else statement. 

Next, I was struggling on building the responsive navigation bar, particularly how to hide it in mobile version. In order to get it done, I spent time on reading a lot of relevant articles and looked for questions on StackOverflow. The solution was using transform(translateX()) to move the navigation bar from left to right. I believe that there are many other ways which you can use to solve it such as adjusting height, width, or using display:none. Overally, it depends on how you want style the transition! 

Thirdly, with a background in motion deisgn, I was able to combine my animation knowledge, creativity, and CSS skill and applied some cool animation to the site. 

In conclusion, I've learned a lot and I do believe we can always make it better. If I had more time, I will build more structrure design in Figma. As you can see in the link below, the prototype is not yet completed. Definitely, it does make an impact on the web visual and save time on styling in CSS. In the booking section, I want to search for better Javascript solution to loop over the destinations back and forth, when the next/prev button is clicked. I can't wait to learn more about it in the upcoming week.
