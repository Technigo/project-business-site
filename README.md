# Business Site

The assignment was to build a business site with a form and using JavaScript for an accordion. I have made a site for tracking climbs in mountains, just like others track workouts. 

## The problem

I started with the design and the idea. Next I spent a lot of time figuring out JavaScript. I also used some CSS to style buttons and the accordion. If I had more time I would have wanted to use more JavaScript.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
