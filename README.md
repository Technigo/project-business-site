# Business Site

This weeks assignment was to create a business site displaying of responsive image or video hero, a sticky navbar, a form and an accordion that would collapse when active. We were to use mainly html and css but also som javascript.



## The problem

I started with a sketch, reading up on the material and googling for inspiration. For my site I used a video hero with an overlay text for desktop, an image for tablet and another image for mobile. I used media queries together with display: none/inline to control what image or video was availble for different screen widths. 

I used flexbox for creating the main section consisting of the sign-up form and the accordion. I managed to customize the buttons and checkboxes in a really neat way. I was very pleased until I realized that the styling was messing with how the data was sent on to the http:bin. So styling had to go for the sake of function and lack of time.

I found a really cool candy clicker on codepen - a button that shoots out candy emojis when clicked. I copied the code and modified it slightly. I also tried to understand what the js code did and removed some code that wasn't necessary. I have som emoji leakage I could not get rid off however. Every time the page is refreshed, stars come shooting out.

The accordion was a challenge - I followed a very good video-tutorial and tried to understand what the code actually did. I need practice.

If I have had more time I would have applied more input types in the form, gone deeper with customizing buttons/boxes and taking it a bit slower with the js part.
