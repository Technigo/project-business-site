# Business Site
This weeks assignment was to bulid a business site including a responsive background image or video. The site also should have a sign up form and an accordion section.

## The problem
I started with drawing a sketch on how I wanted the site to look. When I started coding I did the site structure first and then started to experiment a bit more. I've used a sign up form, an accordion section and a background image that's responsive. This time I didn't make the whole site responsive since I spent quite time to understand and learn sign up form an accordion. If I had more time I would have done the whole site responsive and spent some more time on the accordion design.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
