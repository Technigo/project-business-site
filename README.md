# Business Site

The assignment was to build a business site with: 
a header with responsive image/video,
a sign up form with minimum three different input types and
accordion built with javascript. 

## The problem

First I built site's basic structure and did the responsive header. Then I built the sign up form because it felt easier than the accordion section which I built last. I used javascript, flexbox, css-grid and media-queries. If I would have had more time I would have tried to do the blue and red level requirements.
