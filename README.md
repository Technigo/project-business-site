# Business Site

The assignment was to build a business site with a hero image, form and a FAQ accordion.

It was the first project to include JS.

I quite enjoyed it but as always there's always more things you want to do but time limits how far you can go. 
## The problem

My biggest issue was planning. I got a bit excited to start the project so I didn't go through the course material completely before starting to code and then I had a hard time to stop coding to look at the videos and read the texts. So for next time I intend on sticking to a better time plan and to do things in order. I've used Trello for the coding but realised I have to use it for the entire process to keep more organized. 

If I had more time I would've done a pop out menu from the hamburger. I found it very easy to twist it with a toggle but struggled to find a way to create the menu. I tried to creat the menu in HTML and then apply JS to it but couldn't make it work. But I intend on doing one in a future project as I learn more and more about JS.

Besides that I didn't really meet any obstacles in doing the assignment.
