# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
The project was to build a responsive site with a form, connected to httpbin.org, and build a accordion with JS. The header should include a big hero img or a video.

It was a lot of fun once I got started. I am new to javascript and I still have a hard time to understand how it works and how the tags are connected. I have used alot of stack overflow, w3 and random googling to wrap my head around it. 

I focused on handling one "problem" at the time. First the header, then the form and last the accordion. Due to learning by trial and error (and copy pasteing) my code was a mess. the mobile first-approach got a bit messed up. I need to be better at keeping it clean next week.

I had unneccesary problems with the accorion. If I had read the brief more closely I would have solved the problems quicker.

I used the picture-tag for the header img, but switched in the end. It looked better with the background img, and was easier to style. I kept the picture-tag in the code for my own remembering. 

I am proud of figuring out the accordion, and that I took the time to practice som grid in the footer. I am also pleased that I went with the background img, even though it felt like a simpler way to code. But hey - maybe thats good. 

If I had more time I want to try using a video instead. I would like to improve the + and - signs at the accordion, they dont look 100% to me. 

I also have a problem with the widht of the boxes in screen mode. The form-box isnt as wide as I would like. Ive played around with margins and flows, but will leave it like it is. It looks good to me.
