# Business Site


I wanted to create a business for selling plants. I thought this would be easy to obtain nice free images and should ne workable. The site should have a sign-up form, a Hero image and an accordion styled with JS.
## The problem

I approached the problem using a mobile-first methodology and flex box. The idea was for the content of the accordion and sign-up form to not vary, only their positions on the website. I used JS to make the accordion interactive AND also the form interactive as well. I custome styled the sign-up checkboxes and radio buttons. I did want to add an icon to the accordion, but I didn't have time.
