# Business Site

This project is about building a responsive business website with a hero image or video for the header, a form and an accordion-FAQ (JS). I chanelled my inner buddha and decided to build a website for a meditation center. Namast√© 

## The problem

I started with the mobile-site. 
- I used a hero-image in the background for the header in respect of data usage.
- I build and styled a form with 4 different inputs (text, number, email, radio button) and a submit button
- I build a FAQ-accordion with basic js

On tablet-size the hero-image changes to a video

On desktop-size the form and the accordion are hidden and get only displayed after clicking the links to introduction and FAQ in the header. This works by selecting the screensize with js and then display or hide different sections of the site.

!!This feature only fully works after reloading the page once you scaled it up your down between mobile/tablet/screen-size!!

I need to dig deeper in order to find out, how to prevent this and of course there could be more styling and features both on the form and the accordion. But I want to state, that I am still quite proud about what I achieved this week with using js first the first time. :)
