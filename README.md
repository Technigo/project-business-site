This is a project made during my third week at the Technigo bootcamp. The learning objective was to create a business one pager website.

# Business Site

I chose to create a page for a business offering courses in bookbinding. The focus of the assignment was practicing image backgrounds, HTML forms and modify DOM with JavaScript. Therefore the main elements of the page consist of a video header, a signup form and an accordion. 

## The problem

I worked in VS Code and started with the header, wanting to practice adding herovideos instead of images. For a responsive layout I tried adding different videos but in the end managed to get it working with just one size, I use flexbox and mediaqueries. I created a logo myself and got the video from pexels.com. If I had more time I would work more on the form and accordion layout. Unfortunately working on the responsive layout took too much time so I didn't get to work with styling of radio buttons for instance. Solving the accordion with javascript was also a challenge that took a while to get into work. Still the responsive work is not great, next time I will definitley practice mobile first!
