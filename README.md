# Business Site

A project consisting of building a business site with a form and a hero section with a video or image.

## The problem

I started from forms that I like and tried to imitate them as much as possible. 

I ran into problems like different types of inputs had different styles by default which made me have to work more with my css and classify to be able to get different inputs as similar as possible.

If I had more time I would have added a footer and worked more on the responsive design for smaller screens
