# Business Site
The objective in thi assignment was to create a business site where the site should include a hero image or video, a form and a accordion.

I went for creating a fake non profit org that works with promoting Earth care and earth hour.

## The problem
In this project I used Html, CSS and Javascript. 
I started with finding a video that I could base my business on and from there began planing my layout. I quickly decided that I wanted the hero-video to be fixed as I imagined it would look cool if the form and accordion were floating on scroll. 

I used VS code and mozilla dev tools to create, inspect and update my code. I also checked that the code works well on my mobile device. 

If I had more time I would add more javascript functions to make my site more interactive. For example adding icons that expload or showcase information in a cool way.
