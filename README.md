# Business Site

The goal of this project was to create a business site including a hero image, a form and an accordion.

## The problem

After I had built the basic layout, I focused on building one thing at a time (hero image, form, accordion), then add the styling. I challenged myself with customizing radio buttons and checkboxes, which went well.
