# Business Site

Assignment: 
To create a business site that contained a hero image, form and accordion together with JavaScript. 


## The problem

I had problem that my nav-bar wasn't on top of other elements, solved by using z-index set to 1. 

If I had more time I would have looked up JavaScript even more to make my navbar collapse once I clicked on an menu alternative.
