# Business Site
This week’s project was to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus was to practice what you've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem
## Signup form
In the site, I have made a signup form which post the data from the form into a service called HTTPBin and it should show the data the user put in. It is basically a server and will work in the same way as if we posted this data to our own server to for example create a user account.
This was the main question I asked during working on Signup form.
- How does the textfields look like?
- What response do you get from the password field?
- Try select one or a few of the radio buttons & submit again. What changes?
- Select none of the radio buttons & submit.
- Check the checkboxes & submit.
- Leave the checkboxes unchecked & submit.

### **Accordion**
The website should also have an **accordion**, meaning an area that can collapse to show and hide text. These are very often used on FAQ sections.
I made sure that the javascript file is linked from the HTML. Use CSS to show/hide. Once I had one section showing and hiding, I moved on to update the JavaScript to call the toggle function for all of the sections.
