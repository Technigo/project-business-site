# Business Site

It's a bussiness site that specializes on really obscure electronic music. For those who want to discover "new wavelengths of music"! You subscribe and they sent you a new LP each month.

## The problem

Thankfully it went pretty smoothly compared to the previous project. I had trouble with my hero-image and got help at the on-call-support. Another problem that came up was that I could mark all the radio buttons instead of just choosing one. But I got the answer I needed on stackoverflow.

For this project I decided to start with the structure instead of starting from the styling like on the previous project and it worked muchmuch better. I'm going to continue working like that.
