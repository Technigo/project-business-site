# Business Site

I needed to create a responsive one-page website for a business, with a particular focus on practicing my skills in HTML forms. The website was to include a header featuring a responsive image or video, along with a signup form that utilized at least three different input types.

I also needed to ensure the page was styled and fully responsive, making sure it looked good on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops. Throughout the project, I also needed to follow best practices for clean and maintainable code.

## The problem

I wanted to try and make a hero with a video background with the sign up form inside it. As a bonus I also added a section underneath with some ads and a filtering option on categories.

I also added a hamburger menu that can be opened and closed. The JavaScript I have added was written with the help of ChatGPT. I provided it with my markup and what I wanted to achieve.

If I had more time I would have looked into creating a custom select so that I could style the dropdown as well.

I've also explored using CSS Nesting since it newly became a baseline feature of CSS.
