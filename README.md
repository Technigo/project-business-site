#Project 2 Business website for a coffee shop

This is a Coffee shop webpage with a video header for desktop and responsive images for tablet/mobile. It has a sign up form and an accordion with questions/answers made with Javascript.
###The focus here is:
To practice using image backgrounds, video as a header, HTML forms, Javascript accordion and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

##The process

I visualized my website in 3 resolutions(mobile,tablet,desktop) in Figma.
I used flexbox to align elements in the main section, styled sign up form with CSS and created the accordion with Javascript.

##Challenges to solve
Create a sticky navbar and add a favicon.
