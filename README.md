# Business Site - [View Live!](https://ylvas-buiness-site.netlify.app/)

The assigment is to create a Buisness Site which has the following content:

* Hero image/video
* Signup form
* FAQ section (able to expand/collapse description)

## The problem

### Tools and techniques

* Flexbox & media queries for responsivness (mobile, tablet and desktop)
* `<form> </form>` for Signup form
* Accordion, an area that can collapse to show and hide text

### Planning

I started with a sprint planning and was breaking down the work in small tasks (added into Trello).

In HTML file I started to add html element needed for my site, like a template.

Started from the top of the site and worked down to the bottom.

### Had more time, I would have done this next

TODO
