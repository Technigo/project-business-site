# Business Site

We made a form for a dogcare service called Paw Pals.
We included text field, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit button.


## The problem
We started with a sketch on Figjam and then started the HTML skeleton, then worked on CSS.

We had trouble aligning and spacing the weekdays with the checkboxes. We also had issues requiring only one checkbox to be checked instead of all of them.
