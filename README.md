# Business Site

This week's project is to build a buisness site with a header with a img or video, a form, a accordion, etc...

I going to do a buisness site for a metal music festival.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

FORM
