# Business Site

I have created a landingpage with a hero image/element, a form to collect information and sign up, and also an accordion for faq.

## The problem

The bigges issue I had that took a lot of time was my problem to get the Desktop layout to be responsive. After googling and asking for help from my team and a former student at Technigo and it still didnt work I was about to give up and let it be unresponsive. Then I saw a spelling error in the media queries head line... So when that was fixed it worked.. :) So much struggle and time spent for so little!

I aslo believe I have complicated the code and done a lot of adds and removes and now I dont know if there is and code in there that accually doesnt need to be.  For next time I need to keep it more simple. 

If I had more time I would have liked to practice more JavaScript. I feel that I still lack the basics and have a hard time to understand.
Also I had done more detailed functions and some styling.
