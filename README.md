# Business Site

This week assignment was to create a one page bussiness site. The requirements were a form and an accordion that should use JavaScript to expand.


## The problem

I started the planning with a sketch for the different sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). I decided then to use a picture, instead of a video, as my hero image since it would complement my theme better. The forms were not so difficult to make, but tricky to style. I styled the radiobuttons and checkboxes and still think those are really complicated to work on (but worth the struggle). The accordion took some try outs to perfect and I'm still not 100% happy with it's styling. 

I searched a lot on the internet for this project and watched the Technigo's videos multiple times, but I'm quite happy and proud of the result.
