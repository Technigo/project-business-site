# Business Site
The assignment was to design a buisness website with a submission form and accordion FAQ. 

## The problem
We first did a design idea on figma so we had an overall idea of how to approach the layout. Then we began to use HTML to create the structure we wanted for the site. We continued on with Javascript for our accordion and lastly did the styling with CSS. 

If we had more time we could have a navbar and have more examples for our buisness including more images and ideas of how the buisness could work.
