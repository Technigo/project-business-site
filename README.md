# Business Site

I have built a site with a hero image header, a form and an accordion. It's a site for a Spa, where you can book your stay and read about treatments and activities in an accordion.

## The problem

I made a responsive hero image, in which I changed the position of the text for different screen sizees. In the form I tried to make the dates update automatically in javascript, but it only worked for the check in dates
