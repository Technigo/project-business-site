# Business Site

The task was to create a business one pager with a header with covering background image or video, a form with different input types and an accordion FAQ. 

## The problem

My first focus was to make sure to get all of the elements in my code. When that was done I focused on the JavaScript to make the accordion work properly. In the end I've spent my time to make it look better with CSS the content itself, the background image and so on. 

If I were to have more time I would style the form inputs. Make it look more coherent to the rest of the styling.
