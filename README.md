# Business Site 👩‍💼

The goal for this project was to make a business site that includes a hero image/video, a form and a Javascript accordion.

## The problem 💪

I started with the idea in my head and draw a brief sketch on a piece of paper. My plan was to start with the hardest first, which to me was the Javascript accordion. That actually took me longer than expected, but I think I finally grabbed the concept. The problem was that I was left with very little time to think about the layout design and making the site responsive (which I'm still struggling with). If I had more time I would go over Flebox and responsiveness again and try different ways. I would also take a look at how to add more style to it. Styling forms looks actually really hard.
