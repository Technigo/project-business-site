## Description

The Flower Shop website template is designed to showcase the services of a flower shop. It includes the following sections:

- Header: Displays the shop's name and a brief description.
- Navigation: Allows users to navigate between different sections of the website.
- Images: Displays images of flower bouquets.
- Form: Allows users to order flower bouquets by providing their name, email, bouquet size, delivery time, and an optional message.

## The Problem

When creating this template, the challenge was to design a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that effectively presents the flower shop's offerings. The website needed to be responsive to various screen sizes and devices.

## Approach

To address the challenge, the following approach was taken:

- **HTML and CSS:** The template was built using HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling. Media queries were used for responsive design to ensure the website looks good on different devices.
- **Images:** High-quality images of flower bouquets were selected to visually engage users and convey the shop's products effectively.
- **Form:** A user-friendly order form was designed to gather necessary details for flower bouquet orders.
- **Navigation:** A navigation bar was included to help users easily explore different sections of the website.

With more time, additional enhancements could be made to improve user experience and accessibility, such as adding more interactive features, optimizing images, and further refining the responsive design.
