# Business Site

The assignment was to build a Business site containing a HTML Sign up form and an accordion for FAQ. The site should also contain a hero-image/video and have a toggle function for the accordion using Javascript. 

## The problem

I decided that I was going to create a site for a dog rescue. I wanted to include as much as possible of what we learned on the previous project (project-news-site), so I also wanted to incorporate a nav-bar and build a responsive site. I also wanted to learn and incorporate grid, since I had only used flexbox earlier. I structured my project by first writing the HTML and applying some basic CSS to get a clearer image of the layout. I then focused on making the Javascript for the accordions work properly. Lastly I did the last styling elements to get the site looking a little nicer. 

Im happy with the outcome of the page and that I achieved some of my stretch-goals; like adding an icon for the accordions, a slide-down effect and validation for the form. If I had more time I would have put some more time into perfecting the responsiveness of the page.
