# Business Site

This is a project for the Technigo Remote Boot Camp to learn and practice video and image backgrounds and HTML forms.


## The problem

The site should include a header with responsive image/video background, a sign-up form and a FAQ Accordion.
After going trhough this week's learning material, I made a scetch. 
Started coding trying to do a video header background, decided to leave that for later and made a header background with background-image then focused on the HTML sign-up form and accordion. I used the learning material plus stack Overflow and google (mmainly found answers in MDN adn w3school) and pushed a first version to GitHub.
Then updated the heading background to video (and adjusted the styling).
