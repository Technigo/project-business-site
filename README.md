# Business Site

This is the third project of Techigo's bootcamp. The assignment was to create a business website with a responsive header, a form and an accordion. 

## The problem
The header is responsive for mobile and desktop, it works ok for tablet. The mobile version recieves an image instead of a video to save data. 
The form sends to httpbin and there is a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 99, the border becomes solid when focused and the button is responsive.
I would have liked to make the date input only be available from today, but I do not know enough Javascript yet. 
The accordion is my first javascript project. There is also a transition and an icon which changes whether it is active or not. 
The wider background of the headlines was a padding mistake that I decided to keep because I thought it looked nice.
