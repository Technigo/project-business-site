# Business Site

The task was to create a business site with one responsive hero image, one form and one accordion. 

## The problem

I used "background-image" for the hero image and javascript for opening and closing the accordion. 
If I had more time I would have tried to style the radio- and checkbox-buttons. 

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
