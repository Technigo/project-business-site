# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
The project was to build a responsive site with a form, connected to httpbin.org, and build a accordion with JS. The header should include a big hero img or a video.

It was a lot of fun once I got started. I am new to javascript and I still have a hard time to understand how it works and how the tags are connected. I have used alot of stack overflow, w3 and random googling to wrap my head around it. 

I focused on handling one "problem" at the time. First the header, then the form and last the accordion. Due to learning by trial and error (and copy pasteing) my code was a mess. the mobile first-approach got a bit messed up. I need to be better at keeping it clean next week.

I had unneccesary problems with the accorion. If I had read the brief more closely I would have solved the problems quicker.

I used the picture-tag for the header img, but switched in the end. It looked better with the background img, and was easier to style. I kept the picture-tag in the code for my own remembering. 

If I had more time I want to try using a video instead, and I want to style the footer with grid containers. I would like to improve the + and - signs at the accordion, they dont look 100% to me.
