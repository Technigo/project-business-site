# Business Site


The task was to create a business website with the primary goal of building a signup form that includes at least three different input types. I used a submit button, text fields (for name and email), and a checkbox input. Additionally, we were required to have a hero section. I decided to focus on the signup form and aimed to give the website a slightly fashionable look and feel.

## The problem

I encountered an issue where the backdrop filter blur worked in the browser's developer tools but not on an actual mobile device. I resolved this by adding -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px); to ensure it works properly across all browsers.
