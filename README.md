# Business Site

The purpose of the project was to create a business site with a HERO section, a form and an accordion.

I planned the site in FIGMA and followed the theme of the draft pretty on point but made some necessary changes on the details.

## The problem

When I encountered problems I put some efforts into solving them but not too much. I wanted to implement instant validation in the form and sat with this for a while but decided to press pause on that one to be able to continue with the rest of the site. I also struggled a bit with the expanding of the accordion. I used max-height as the property for expanding the accordion to make the content box responsive. This resulted in some lag when collapsing the accordion. I tried to fix this with transition-delay but that didn't do the trick. I experience no lag when using a fixed height instead but that doesn't make the box responsive, unfortunately.

If I would have had more time with this site I would have continued with the accordion and try to find a way to remove the lag while still keeping the box responsive. I would also continue with implementing validation and instant validation to the sign up form.
