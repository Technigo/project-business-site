# Business Site
The assignment was to create a buisness site with a responsive header of an image/video and a signup form including three different input types. 
I choose to do a music synch website that I named FemScore Media.

I created a music synch website where you can request to buy licensed music created by women. Once the client fills in the sign up form by making a request on the site, they can use the chosen song in other medias such as TV/Film, SoMe and advertisment.

## The problem
For this project I planned the whole business idea first including the buisness content and name etc. Then I used a pen and paper to sketch out the website layout and structure. In terms of the coding I approchead problems all the time and solved them along the way, using a combination of watching videos on disco, google, stack overflow and chatgpt.

If I had more time I would focus a bit more on styling the page in CSS. I initially focused on the requirments and then I moved on to adding more code in the HTML- and the CSS-document mainly for a more aesthetic look. Considering I'm a beginner in coding I'm happy with the result but I would add/change some styling elements if I had more experience, knowledege and time. Another thing I tried was to follow the clean code guide but my code kept jumping back to the "none-clean code" as soon as I saved it. I solved it by turning the format save off in vs code preferences. I'm not sure that's the right way to do it.
