# Business Site

The project was to design a business site with hero image, accordion and a form.

## The problem

I tried to keep it simple and only have the necessities in the different versions.
For example the FAQ and links in the header aren't displayed in the mobile version, and the layout changes depending on device.
For the accordion I used javascript to toggle and collapse.

If I hade more time I would make a sign up form that extends up from the sign up-button.
I would also make a dropdown menu in the mobile version where you can click on a FAQ link and have a FAQ accordion in that version too.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
