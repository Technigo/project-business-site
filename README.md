# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business website of our choice. It had to contain a responsive hero video/image, a signup form  and an accordion made with basic JS.

I chose to make one about a Rabbit convention. 

## The problem

I started with the responsive hero video with a header in the middle. 
Then I focused on the signup form and at last the accordion using Javascript.

The problem I had was the lack of time because of certain private reasons. I solved it by focusing more on finishing the requirements rather than focusing more on the design.
