# Business Site

I need to build a one-pager business site with a hero image, sign up form, faq accordion using JS. Last week I do not have the chance that add to my project grid, so I did it for this project. 

## The problem

I had a problem with the radio button styling, but I found a youtube tutorial where I undrestood the steps and it worked. If I had more time, I style it more 2020ish. 

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
