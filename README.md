# Business Site

For this project i chose to build a business landing page for guided bus tours in Scotland. I designed a page with a hero image, 3 info-elements and one form to if you want to book a guided tour.

## The problem

I started of by making a design in figma. I started by watching/googling how to make a hero image to start with. And it was more tricky then I imagined - but I managed to do it! I did the landing page in general and did the form last of all. I didn't want the input of the form to be to big of a size - and therefor I used flexbox to put the label and input next to each other. And did the same for the other element in the form as well. For the form I used input type: number, text and email.

I felt I could have worked much longer with the styling and fonts in general for the landing page. But also tried out more attributes for the form.
