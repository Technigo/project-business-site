# Business Site

The assignment was to build a business site with a form and using JavaScript for an accordion. I have made a site for tracking climbs in mountains, just like others track workouts. 

## The problem

I started with the design and the idea. Next I spent a lot of time figuring out JavaScript. I also used some CSS to style buttons and the accordion. If I had more time I would have wanted to use more JavaScript.
