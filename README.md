# Business Site

This is a fake publishing house website created using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. 

## The problem

I started to visualize(paper pototype) the final product and started bulding components for mobile and then for the other devices. I used flexbox to align the content on the page and JavaScript to get the accordion to work. The form uses HTTPBin to see the data collected. The form has validation as some fields are required and need to have a @ in them.  Going forward with this project I would like to look more into animations and JAvaScript to develop the look even more.
