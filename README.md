# Business Site

The mission was to do a responsive business-site with a hero-header, a form and a accordion. I did a new website for my own company Escape House.

## The problem

I started with a more thourough planning stage then I had in my last project. I had an idea that I would only use grid in this project but realised that I probably need to think of grid and flex as complements to eachother and not exclusive.

The hardest part for me was to get the grid to work on the accordion. When i realised that I needed to think of the "answers" as a part of the grid everything sorted itself, but it took some hours.

Since I choose to getelementsbyclass I got a list and then I remembered from a past JS course that I could do a for loop to do the work for me. The hardest part within JS was setting up the chevron arrow to change directions. Took a little time before realising what the active + meant in the css=D

Loved the BEM -method and will use it for my upcomeing projects.

If i would have had more time I would try to make another solution for the flex-containers. I didnt think of the fact that the background color was different for the each sections of the code which made it a bit annoying to work with since I in "desktop view" didnt want the content to take up the full width (on big screens).
