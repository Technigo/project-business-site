# Business Site

A business site containing a hero, sign up form and FAQ accordion.

## The problem

I started the project by making a sketch in Figma, illustrating the layoute in different views (mobile, tablet and desktop). https://www.figma.com/file/cR2Ua67mw2ZUOzXLPBHRWP/Business-site?node-id=0%3A1

The webpage is developed with the mobile-first approach. The structure of the page are based on HTML, styled with CSS and JavaScript to create interactive elements.

The moste difficult part was to style and aligne the form and how to modify the DOM using Javascript.

If I had more time I would have trid out different functions with JS.
