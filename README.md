# Business Site

This is my front end boot camp assignment number 2 creating a site for an existing or fictional company. Minimum requirements: the site should contain a responsive hero image, a functioning accordion and a fill out form.

## The problem

I choose to create a fictional company site for Aurora excursions. The site has a non-functioning menu, a company logotype/title and a hero image. The hero image changes depending on screen size (mobile, tablet, desktop) as well as the size of the menu and logotype. 

I used media queries and flexbox to make the accordion and form section layout differently in mobile, tablet and desktop view.

For the accordion function I used JavaScript to make an answer pop down when clicking on the various FAQ information headers, and when doing so the curser will change to "grab". 

The first three text filds in the form section contains placeholders and will also make an alert if not filled in properly. I have made custom made radio buttons to correspond nicer with the colors of the hero images, where you can select the package of your preference. The form also has a drop down menu selecting numbers of guests for the adventure. The bottom text field allows for more text vertically if necessary, but not horizontally. 

When filling out the form and hitting "Submit" all information is sent to a httpbin for the company to collect the data from the booking.

If I had more time the next step in my project would be to create a functioning menu and to style the Submit button in a slightly different manner to make it stand out more.
