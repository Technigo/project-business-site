# Business Site

☕ The goal for this project is to create a site for a company of our choice. It must have a responsive Hero Header, a signup form and an FAQ accordion made with JavaScript and CSS.

I'm a big coffee nerd, so decided to create this **"Coffee Collective"**, where you can book coffee tastings for groups. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.dropcoffee.com/">Drop Coffee Roasters</a>, one of my favorite cafés here in Stockholm. 🤗

## How I built it - What I learned

- The Hero Header for this site must be responsive, so my approach was to have 3 different images with different sizes: one for desktop, tablet and mobile - so depending on the device, the appropriate image will be loaded, resulting in a better loading time. 👌
- Since the header has a background image, learned to do a backdrop for the main title (using CSS), so that it's more readable.
- The form is being submitted to HTTP BIN until we learn in the future what to do with the collected data. Learned about GET and POST methods.
- This is the first time we get to use JavaScript in the bootcamp 💥, so we learned about modifying elements with the DOM. Managed to create an accordion using a simple toggle function and with several CSS animations in place.
