# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site that contained a responsive hero image or video, a sign up form with checkboxes and a button and also an accordian with JavaScript attached to it. 

## The problem

I looked at all of the material on Canvas/Notion to get a good understanding of each element. I then started to build my site. I used google and found W3Schools most helpful. I demoed my site and got tips from my team about how to solve issues. If I had more time I would make sure that I used the correct method of making background images responsive because I am not sure that I solved that.
