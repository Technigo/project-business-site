Business site with main focus on a hero video, an accordian and a sign up form.

## Thoughts

I divided all sections into different folders in the beginning. Making a separate code for the hero video, the accordian and the sign up form. Just to make sure the functionality is working before getting into styling the whole site. 

When everything worked as I wanted to, I combined all the different folders into one. 

If I had more time, I would be spending time on the layout and making a navbar or a sidebar.

## What I learned ðŸ§ 

* How to use image or video in the header, for responsive webpages
* How to use HTML forms and simple requests
* How to modify the DOM using Javascript

## Requirements I reached ðŸ§ª

* Site has a header with responsive image/video
* Site has a signup form
* Site has a FAQ accordion
* How to use `:focus` pseudo-selector in CSS

## Stretch-goals I reached ðŸ§˜

* Added an icon before the title in the accordion that indicates whether the section is expanded or collapsed. It updates when the section expands or collapses.
* Added a slide-down animation effect when the accordion expands and collapses.
* On hover, changed the mouse cursor to something other than the default.
* Added a focus effect on the input tags.
* Added validation to the form.
* Added a header and a button on top of your video by using `position: absolute` and `z-index`
