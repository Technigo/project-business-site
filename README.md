# Business Site

Project 3 of the Technigo Bootcamp was to create a business site with a hero, a form and an accordion.
## The problem
I planned better this week, did a proper mockup and a backlog, so the work was much more effective, and I felt more in control. The hero and form gave me no major problems, I had some issues with aligning the radio buttons, but found the solution on Stack Overflow. The accordion was a bit of a challenge, IÂ´m still struggeling a bit with grasping Javascript, but I found a good tutorial that walked me through it.
If I had more time I would have styled the form more, the initial plan was for an img background, styled input fields and more styling on the button.
