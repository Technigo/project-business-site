The assignment was to create a responsive business one-pager that included a form with a fieldset.
The code was asked to be written clean and with a clear semantic structure.

I started by drawing out an example for my wished end result. Not knnowing exactly what I wanted, I created a simple draft with which I played around with until I found the looks I was happy with.

Like in a previous project, I gave all "boxes" their borders and colors, so I could nore easily understand and see what was happening each time I did changes in my code. My browser was always open to that I could try out different thing, and follow each step.

With more time I would have a video in my hero section, a menu and a footer that includes more information. I would also spend more time on creating a better looking hero section with a well designed logo (which I haven't figured out how to do yet).
