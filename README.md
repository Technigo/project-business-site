## Business Site

This is a business site for a fictive company called "Weekly flowers". The site had to include following sections:
- Hero image (picture or video)
- Form with different input types 
- Accordion with JS


## The problem
My process looks as follows (with some itterations in between):
- Sketch and wireframing on paper
- Prototype in Figma
- Edit image in Photoshop
- Practicing forms
- Building site with HTML and CSS
- Practicing JavaScript 
- Adding JavaScript

I started to make a prototype in Figma for mobile and desktop. I thinkt it´s very useful when I start coding to know how I want it to look. I start with the header section and continue with the other sections. I try to follow a plan, but I let myself to changes that I think have big impact and take less time.  

I used the forEach method on my NodeList "question". The method is looping over each item in the array (NodeList) and executes a function for every item within the array (NodeList).
I used an EventListner that listen to a "click" and executes a function that toggles a class n the current targeted item to make the accordion answer add class "active" on click that shows the answer (hidden from start). I wrote my functions as an arrow function according to ES6. 

I have aslo used two ways of manipulating the data from the form input to use in a message for the user when clicking submit. 

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

If I had got more time I would plan the functionality more in depth before. To know what I have to look up and think of when I am doing my design an choose my selectors. I would also rearrange my form section, eg. the textarea to be divided in 3 parts for the adress instead of one. Next time I will try to add a video instead of a picture for the hero image just to try that out.   

I´ve used the following tools: Figma, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and HTTPBin.
