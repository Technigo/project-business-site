# Business Site

This week's project was about practising hero image or video in the header, using HTML forms and simple requests and modifying the DOM using Javascript.
The website built is an imaginary business site.

## The problem

I had some problems with placing two containers next to each other when the screen is large (for example laptop), but staying on top of each other in a smaller screen. I was trying to solve it with giving the containers float:left and percentage width. The problem was that the margins weren't equal on all sides. I am not sure if there would be some more bullet-proof way to do this.

Another problem was placing an arrow in the accordion showing if the accordion is active or not. The problem seemed to be in the missing max-height in the accordions which then solved the problem.
