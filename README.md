# Business Site

This week's project was about building a responsive site with a signup form and and an accordion, typical for FAQs.

## The problem

I used JS for the first time for the accordion, which was tricky but I learned a lot. I am still not feeling 100% sure when to use class/ID or when I can target an element by using semantic attributes.
