# Business Site

Build a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. 

## The problem

I think this was a fun project. I stated out in figma and designd how I wanned it to look and then I build it from top to bottom. I loved the idea to use a hero video. My biggest hang up were to get the javaScript to work. Turend out to be ha > to much. If I had more time would link the navbar buttons so it moves you to the right place on the screen.
