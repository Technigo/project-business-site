# Business Site

To create a styled website site with a few more advanced functions in javascript (accordion and sign-up form).

## The problem

At first I used felxbox to solve the layout and design och the website. This was surprisingly easy compared to last week. 
To create the form I used the form-tag in HTML. To create the accordion I used a toggle-function in JS. I didn't plan much this time which I suffered from. I was better at designing the layout but should have spent more time on a code-structure in advance. 
If I had more time I would have worked more on the layout and got it to a point where it was more responsive.
