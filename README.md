# Business Site

Business site for an insurance company. A FAQ accordion with js functions to expand to see the answers when the question is clicked and a form to sign up to the services. There is also a function that will give a thank you message when the form is submitted with the first name and the type of insurance selected.

## The problem

The biggest problem posed was that of the accordion expanding in a nice way. I struggled with it quite a lot but then we got the tip from Karin about a video with simple instructions that I followed and it was quite an easy problem to solve once you understood that the transition needed a set height and not just display:block/none.

The responsiveness problems from last week were also quite a bit easier to handle this week. I tried some grid as well as flexbox and I think I needed to use media queries a lot less this week beacuse of better use of the flex/grid.
