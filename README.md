# Business Site Project
Mission was to make a business site, a one pager, that should contain an image or video header, a signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

I started to look through the mission brief, tried to find all needed parts and list them. Focused on the technical parts, not the design from start. Then I tried to learn the parts and code them and to get them to work, one at a time. 

I coded in VS Code, used Live Server to update and the Inspector in Chrome to view code and functions. I used google fonts and a image from Unsplash. Did som scaling in Photoshop to have a smaller image for mobile version, to load faster.

If I hade more time I would like to put in more information and to actually think about the purpose on the page. Maybe something for the future. :)
