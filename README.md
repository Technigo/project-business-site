# Business Site

A business one pager website with a hero image, signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

I started with the hero image and the basic HTML layout. Then I set up the Javascript file and and added CSS styling for the signup form and the accordion. This week I learned a bit more advanced CSS (pseudo class selectors and combinator selectors) and how to modify the DOM with Javascript. If I had more time I would create a header and/or footer, style the checkbox and perhaps change the hero image for a video in the Padlet and Desktop version.
