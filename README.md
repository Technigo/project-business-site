# Business Site
The assignment was to build a responsive business site that consists of:
- A header with a responsive image or video
- A signup form with at least three different input types
- An FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript

Stretch goals that I reached include:
- Additional types of form elements
- Validation to portions of the form
- Icon indicating whether according sections are expanded or collapsed
- Mouse cursor changed on hover
