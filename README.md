# Business Site - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp. Learning objectives:
1. Using image or video in the header, for responsive webpages
2. HTML forms and simple requests
3. Modifying the DOM using Javascript


# Brief
This weekâ€™s project is to create a site for a company of your choice. You can come up with your own fantasy company or use an existing one.
We want you to practice what we've gone through this week so the website should contain these three parts:
Hero image/video
Signup form
Accordion

## Approach
I reviewed as much as this week's lesson materials before starting in on the code, all the while coding-along with the provided video-presentations as much as possible. By the time I started I had some bits of code to copy/paste in as a good starting point. Then it was off to search for a free to use video as the header Hero. The video I chose determined the theme to my page: It's a community cooking school, similar to one I had attended in San Francisco. 
After adressing the requirements, I later found myself hitting a wall with a few items and finally ended up leaving them out. 
1) Originally I had a "Confirm Password" field in the form but couldn't figure out how to validate it (I need more to know more .js!). 
2) Following along with the videos demonstrating formatting custom radio buttons and checkboxes, I was able to do it successfully in CodePen. Unfortunately, when it came to applying it to my site, it really didn't want to work! 

All in all, I'm pleased with where I landed with the site. It felt like a breakthrough just to get the text overlay on the video to work and it was an extra sweet moment when I realized it was one of the items under the Black-level requirements.
