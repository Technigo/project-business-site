# Business Site Project
Mission was to make a business site, a one pager, that should contain an image or video header, a signup form and an accordion. Using CSS and JavaScript.

## The problem

I started to look through the mission brief, tried to find all needed parts and list them. Focused on the technical parts, not the design from start. Then I tried to learn the parts, code them and to get them to work, one at a time.
Then I put them together and started twisting the styling. 

I coded in VS Code, used Live Server to update and the Inspector in Chrome to view code and functions. I used google fonts and an image from Unsplash. Did som scaling in Photoshop to have a smaller image for mobile version, to load faster.

I wanted a high contrast look and the dark background of the body is actually a graphical pattern, "carbon fiber". 

If I hade more time I would like to put in more design elements and test information. Maybe something for the future. :)
