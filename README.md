# Business Site

A responsive single page application where I have used hero video and image, created a form and an accordion with my first JavaScript. Also played around with animations.

## The problem

After sketching on paper it was pretty straightforward to add the hero video. The form and accordion part took some googling after coming together, as well as to get the header and site responsive. If I had more time it would have been neat to add a navbar on top right of the hero video/image.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
