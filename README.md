# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site containing a hero image or video, a sign up form, by using HTML form, and to create an accordion with Javascript.  

## The problem

I had limited amount of time this week so my main goal was to understand and use the developer tool to make changes and to understand the parent/child structure. I felt that it made me understand a little bit more about position relative and absolute and how to think about structure in the future. 
I found a video online that I wanted to use but it was too large so I trimmed it down from 1 min to 10/15s in order to make it work. Turned out that Netlify thought it's too big anymway. I used some of the techniques we learned at this weeks codesessions to place headings etc above the video. 

I wish I had more time to experiment with JS. My plan was to make a "real" hamburger with JS but my time ran out. I also have som more reading to do on adjacent css and how to use it. 


## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
