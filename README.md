# Business Site

In this project we were supposed to create a site for a company. The task was to have a heroimage or video - which should be responsive. And to create some sort of signup form, try out different kind os inputs and also build an accordion with JavaScript.

## The problem

I started with a theme - fashion and then designed the site and filled in all content. My biggest obsticle this week was the accordion, created with JS. I experimented a lot i CodePen but didn't get it to work. Together with two classmates we figured out the problem and it finally worked. I had a backup code I could have used if I wouldn't succeed with the JS we got from the repo. But I really didn't want to use a borrowed code. So I'm really happy about getting it to work. I did spend a lot of time struggeling with the JS so I wish I had had more time to spent on JS and really understand how it works, but unfortunatly I focused on getting the job done and hopefully I have time to deep dive further on.
