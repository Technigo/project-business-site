# Project Business Site

This weeks project was to create a business site for a fictitious company, using a hero image/video as a header. We also had to include a sign-up form and an acordion. The hero image/video had to be responsive to screen size, while the form needed to include a mix of input fields while the FAQ accordion was required to be built with JavaScript.

## The problem

Firstly, I wanted to use a hero video in my header but I also wanted the hero section to be compatible on all devices. So I began by using a hero image on mobile and table and then a video on desktop by using diplay: none in CSS. I added some validation to my form and styled the input fields to give the form a clean look. Also styling the input text and placeholder text so that they looked different.  

I also styled my accordion and targeted the 1st and 3rd rows to make the backround colour slightly different using nth-of-type(). This was initally tricky as (1) doesn't necessairly target the 1st child, so I used trial and error to find the child elements I wanted. I used some basic javascript to create the toggle effect. 


## View it live
I have tested the site on iPhone, iPad and desktop as well as using the developer tool in Google Chrome.
Chrome and Safari (mobile/tablet) are the only browsers I used for testing. 
All platforms are working as required.
