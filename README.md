# Business Site

This is a project during the Technigo Front-end Bootcamp. 
The task was to create a business site with a responsive hero image/video,
sign up form and accordion.

The Breakfast Club is a ficitve company that hosts breakfast events in caf√©s owned by small businesses. 


## The problem

I created a simple design in Sketch and started with mobile first approach. 
I started from the top with the video then when it worked i continued to the form and accordion. 
I've kept the form pretty basic accept from styling the button and centering the content. 
The accordion is my first Javascript code and i started with the basics on how to make it slide down when clicked.
That is made with the Toggle function. After the code worked i added some styling with hover effect, cursor pointer,
border-bottom and the symbol that changes in the left corner. 

I also used a google font for the first time. 
If i had more time i would like to design the form more
