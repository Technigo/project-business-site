# Business Site

This assignment was to create a business-page with a hero-image, a form with different inputs, and strt using javaScript to do a accordion-style faq-section.

## The problem

I planned the page in Jamboard and Trello.
Used flexbox for the layout of the page.

If I have more time I will aim for the stretch-goals for this assignment.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
