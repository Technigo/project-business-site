## Business Site

In this project that I made during the Technigo Boot Camp the assignment was to incorporate an HTML-form, a video header or a background image, and an accordion made with JavaScript. 

## The problem

When the form and the JS-accordion were in place I spent some time getting the video to appear in the right way in the header, using the position and overflow attributes. I styled the accordion to get a slide-down effect and I added an icon in the accordion indicating whether the section is expanded or collapsed. If I had more time I would improve the style of the form, especially focusing on the input fields.
