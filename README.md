# Business Site
I've created a business one-pager website that contains a hero header, a form and responsive design.

## The problem
I used flexbox to place the content and make the design responsive. I made a form with different input types. For my future projects I want to keep exploring both flexbox and css grid. And I also want to try making different types of forms. When I made this site I coded the html first from top to bottom and then I styled it with CSS, starting with the smalest version (mobile first).

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
