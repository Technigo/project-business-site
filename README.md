# Business Site

The assignment was to build a Business site containing a HTML Sign up form and an accordion for FAQ. The site should also contain a hero-image/video and have a toggle function for the accordion using Javascript. 

## The problem

I decided that I was going to create a site for a dog rescue. I wanted to include as much as possible of what we learned on the earlier project (project-news-site), so I also wanted to incorporate a nav-bar and build a responsive site. I also wanted to learn and incorporate grid, since I had only used flexbox earlier. I structured my project by first writing the HTML and then the basic CSS (like the hero-image/video, etc). I then focused on making the Javascript work and then lastly I did the last styling elements to get the site looking a little nicer. 

Im happy with the outcome of the page and that I reached many of the stretch-goals. If I had more time I would have worked some more on the responsiveness and learning more Javascript.
