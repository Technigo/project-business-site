# Business Site

This week’s project was to create a business one pager website with an image or video header, a signup form and an accordion. I've started to build a website for a business network I'm a part of in Jönköping.

## The problem

The focus for this project was to practice what I've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. I choose to do a responsive hero-video banner using flexbox and columns for the contact-form which will stack on top of each other on smaller screens.The accordions functionality is built with JavaScript.
