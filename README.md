# Business Site

This week's project is to build a buisness site with a header with a img or video, a form, a accordion, etc...

I going to do a buisness site for a metal music festival.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

FORM
2020-09-02: Started with the form yesterday... CSS-QUESTION: So things worked out when I changed (from the display: flex;) to display:flexbox; , but I don't know why, I've used display:flex; in my first project and it worked out the way I wanted... don't really know the differents even thoug I googled it, but yet have'nt found information about it... 

VIDEO & TEXT: 
2020-09-02: Wanted to have a title and a navbar on the video, have the video in the background so to say. Googled a lot, but did not find or/and understand really. Then added a navbar with line under links + animation, and I guess the position got it to work on top of the video, even though I don't really understand why. However the function of when you hover over the navbar links doesn't work when on top of the video. With exactly the same code but not in the header, it works. Why?

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
