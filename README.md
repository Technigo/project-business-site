# Business Site
An updated responsive version of a hair salon's website designed as an onepage using html, css. Including a hero-img, a form with some validation, an accordion with some javaScript as well as radio buttons.

## The problem

The challenge was to make it responsive, get the hero image to be adapted to different views and the text to be on top of the image and to use the javaScript for the first time. I i had more time I would work more on de design, the jasvaScript behand the accordion and the validation part in the form to make it smoother.
