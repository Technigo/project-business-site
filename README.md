# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site with a header with responsive image/video (hero), a sign-up form with at least three different input types (radio, checkbox and text). And and a FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript.

## The problem

I first found the hero image and based the business idea around that. I learned a lot about styling background images, buttons, input fields, z-index and vh/vw in this assignment.
