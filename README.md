# Business Site - [View Live!](https://ylvas-buiness-site.netlify.app/)

The assigment is to create a Buisness Site which has the following content:

* Hero image/video
* Signup form
* FAQ section (able to expand/collapse description)

## The problem

### Tools and techniques

* Flexbox & media queries for responsivness (mobile, tablet and desktop)
* `<form> </form>` for Signup form
* Accordion, an area that can collapse to show and hide text

### Planning

I started with a sprint planning and was breaking down the work in smaller tasks (added into Trello).

In HTML file I started to add html element needed for my site, like a template.

Started from the top of the site and worked down to the bottom.

### Had more time, I would have done this next

I feel that I once again have spent to much time on how I want the site to look like instead of just keep it simple (since design isn't my strongest side) and concentrate more on the techiques to be used to create an accordion for example.

I would have wwanted to have time to play around more with the form and change the layout of it.

For me it would have been so nice if I could have got some input regarding font-family, font-size, colors and images.
