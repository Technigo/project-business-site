# Business Site

I worked with mobile as default and added values that needed to be changed to fit tablet and desktop. I started with the faq-form where I worked with java script and then I made the subscribe-form. I later added a footer that is fixed and a header image with title text in it. I then made changes the html and css-file.  

The assignement was to make an image header with text on top and make the header responsive. We should also use java script to make forms. 

This assignement was similar to last weeks so I keept my design for that and concentrated on learning the java script and working with forms and header. I didn't have to much time to study this week due to work so I had to priorise.
If I had more time I wouuld like to implement more java script and maybe tried our the hero video.
