# Business Site

The assignment was to make a business one-pager with a hero image or video, a form and an FAQ accordion. I chose to do my one-pager for my father-in-law's site where he shows his pottery. 


## The problem

I did a quick sketch manually and pinpointed focus-points. In my last project I got lost in the details so it was important for me this time to find a way to keep the bigger picture in mind (so that "has to have" trumps "nice to have" for sure).

I used three different video sizes for my hero video to make the site responsive for different screens. The videos that does not show are set to <display:none> in media queries. The middle screen size has a different video than the others to make the change visible. 

I added a sticky navbar with the help of Javascript. The navbar is below the video, and sticks to the top on scroll.

The main content has a form to book pottery classes for a group of friends,  and a FAQ-accordion. I used flexbox to align all content. The accordion has icons that indicates if the items is collapsed or not. It has a small transitioning on collapse. 

The page also has a footer. Small glimpses of fun are animation on hover on the navbar links, a favicon and an arrow down mouse cursor on the accordion header. 

With more time I would have added a text container in the beginning of the main content, as well as a button on the side of the content to click back up on the page.
