# Business Site

Create a Business site with a Hero image/video, Signup form and FAQ-accordion.

## The problem

I started with a sketch, wrote down what kind of features I wanted on the page. Used Figma for sketching. 
Read about the general och blue level requirements and added more features if I missed something. 
I started with hero image first och made it work, and then replaced it with a video. 

I tried to do the mobile approach first. But find it hard to start with it, because I kept adding more things for the tablet and desktop views. The code got more and more messier. So I had to start over and did the dekstop approach. 

I kept wanting to try out different features and got distracted from the basic requirements. So If I had more time I would try to focusing more on the basic and fundamental requirements instead of putting too much time and effort on some unnecessary feature.
