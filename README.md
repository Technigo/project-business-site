# Business Site

This is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to learn responsive hero images and videos, how to use and style HTML forms and how to create an accordion using javascript. 

All Mountain is a template of a business site where you can find and book your perfect ski holiday. The inspiration for the web page design comes from other ski agencies such as camelsnow.com and powderlife.com. 

## The problem

I started this project by drawing a sketch of the webpage layout, form and accordion. The code was written in VS Code and in pararell I tested and viewed the site by using devtools. 

The site is structured in to four sections: A header section with a hero video, a form section with a textbox and a form, a accordion section built with javascript, and lastly a footer.

I used flexbox to structure the site. I also made it responsive to mobile, tablet and computer, but with main focus on the computer design. The page also has hovering effects and the accordion has a transitioning animation when it is expanded. I have also added some validations to the form.  

Before deploying the news site, I tested it on several browsers such as google chrome, safari and firefox. I also tested the newssite on different devices using devtools in google chrome and safari.

If I had more time I would have tried to write a cleaner css code. I started with the mobile first approach but I have still repeated myself a lot. Additionally, I would have created custom checkboxes and radiobuttons for the form.
