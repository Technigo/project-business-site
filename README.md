# Business Site

My business site with a sign up form for an upcoming event. 

The aim of the third project in the Web Dev bootcamp was to create a responsive business site with a hero image or video in the header and a sign up form with at least 3 different input types.

## The problem

I started out by sketching out on paper how I wanted it to look like. I took inspiration from a landing page/event site that was created with the company confetti´s tool for the company I work at. 

I used Flexbox and fieldset as techniques to setup the hero video and sign up form. 

If I hade more time I would learn more about the forms and try to style them better. I tried to make round check-boxes but it did not work out well and I also tried to remove the default setting of the forms to change the links but it didn´t work.
