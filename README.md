# Business Site
Assignment is to build a business site with a hero, form and accordion. 

I created a site for virtual online yoga classes. 

## The problem

- Put too much time on a footer that I in the end removed. 
- Started to style with mobile first but kept looking at desktop screen and mixed up the mobile and desktop styling. 
- Too much focus on the details.
- Could not decide wether to use grid or flex for the Form and Accordion and spent too much time on that. But good thing is that I learnt a lot of how to use both now. 

If I had more time I would want to ad some animation to the site.
