# Business Site

This was my second project on the Technigo bootcamp. The assigment was to create a website including a responsive video header, a form connected to httbin and having a FAQ with a basic accordion using javascript.

## The problem

If I had more time on this project, I would definitely add some animation to the FAQ that shows and hides depending on if the bar is open or not. 

Also another problem I had was that the black bar around the video is displayed on mobile, later I found out that it was actually included in the sample video file.
