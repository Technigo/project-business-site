# Business Site

Third weeks project in Tehcnigo Bootcamp was to create a business site containing:
- Hero Image or Video
- Signup form
- Accordion
- Javascript connected to accordion

When first looking at the javascript I felt really lost but in the end I got it to work and understood how it was suppose to work for this project. If I had more time I would have wanted to look more into javascript and tried to use it in more ares. But I guess that will come for the following weeks! Looking forward.
