# Business Site

This weeks assignment was to create a business site with an accordion and a sign up form! It should also contain a hero image or video.

## The problem

With last weeks assignment fresh in mind I used the same technique for building the initial structure. After that - I actually googled A LOT this time.
One issue I've had is that my video file is too large. I tried to install lfs plugin but it fucked up the connection to github in some way. So I had to uninstall it and just go with the large video file for this time.

If I had more time I'd put a nav-bar on top of the hero video and also worked more with styling of the radio buttons.
