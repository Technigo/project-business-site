# Business Site

This is my project hand-in for week three. This week the goal was to create a form, an accordion as well as an image header. 

## The problem

The trickiest part of this week's hand-in was to start using, and understandnig, javascript. My personal goal was to simply understand the very basics of javascript. A great thing was that we had such good collaboration in our team. If I would have had more time I would have liked to make a hamburger meny as well as icons in the accordion.
