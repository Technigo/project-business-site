# Business Site

Build a business page with forms and accordion, using html, css and a bit of javascript.

## The problem

I started with planning the page in Figma. Figma is new to me and I really liked working with it.
Coded mobile-first. If I had more time I would have worked more with grid, IÂ´m not 100% content with the layout 
in laptop-format.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
