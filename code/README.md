# Business Site

The assignment is to Build a business site containing a hero image or video, a signup-form and an accordion.

## The problem
I wrote out the structure of the page containing it requeriments on a sketchboard. I started putting in images for the hero-section, structured the accordion and then used javascript for the first time! First felt proud holding down the classes and ids of the elements, then realized I needed unique id's for the javascript. Continued on putting up the structure and elements of the form, then did most of the styling in CSS. If I had more time I would have worked more on the styling of the hero-text and the accordion part.
