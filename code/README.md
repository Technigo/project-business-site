# Business Site

For this weeks project I created a business site that contains a big image of header, a signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

Started with a design, proceeded to build HTML and styling. I then spent some time learning to build a form. I created the accordion as a last step. If i had more time i would focus more on the design in Figma.
