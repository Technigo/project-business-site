      <h2>I have meditated 345 days in a row</h2>
      <p>I have meditated for three hundred and forty-four days in a row. Now it's starting to feel like routine. It took time. And I still feel a restlessness and my thoughts wander in a single jumble. But I'm sitting. Still. Breathe me through it. Counting the breaths to help keep focus on the particular breaths. Lets the thoughts come and go. And trying to feel how the body feels. Right now. Notice and release. Not quite. The most difficult thing is probably not to evaluate how well the meditation goes. To not just accept that this is how it works today. I will continue to practice. Welcome to join!</p>
