      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="question" id="section1">
        For the meditation classes, do I need to bring a cushion and will I have to sit cross-legged on the floor?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        No, all the meditation classes are set out with chairs. If you do wish to sit on the floor you are welcome to, but please bring a cushion.
      </div>
      <div class="question" id="section2">
        If I miss a class or come to a course late in the term, can I still follow what’s being taught?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It is common that people join the course part way through or cannot attend a whole course. For this reason the teacher will explain all the essential points for that night’s meditation and practice. The meditations are guided to help you get the most out of them.
      </div>
      <div class="question" id="section3">
        I have questions and an enquiring mind. Can I ask questions during the class and discuss with others in the group?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The teacher will always invite questions. After the second meditation, small groups are formed to discuss the topic of the class and any other points of interest. It’s all very friendly!
      </div>
      <div class="question" id="section4">
        Is there provision for wheelchair users and what other facilities are available?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The classes are held in purpose designed meeting rooms, most are wheelchair friendly and some have induction loop hearing systems installed.
