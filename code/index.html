          coffee
          cherries. Afterwards, he observed a change in their behavior. They gained a high amount of energy and they
          didn’t
          sleep
          at night. The herder shared his findings with local monks and then after they made a drink with coffee beans,
          they
          realized they could stay up all night and pray. Then, they spread the word to other Ethiopian monks and it
          reached
          across the civilized world."

          drink tea
          for
          the rest of their lives.

          Two physicians were ordered to take tests and deliver the results to the king directly. However, these

          mysteriously died, presumably of natural causes. Before the King could conclude his study, he passed away as
