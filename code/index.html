          The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water
          that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains
          97% of Earth's water.[1] An ocean can also refer to any of the large
          bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally
          divided.[2] Separate names are used to identify five different areas
          of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian,
          Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest).[3][4] Seawater covers
          approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet.

          Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal
          zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone
          consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout
          the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones
          depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone
          includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light
          (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This
          makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants
          and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic
          matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean
          photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere.

          Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents.
          These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting
          upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric
          circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in
          salinity.[7] Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface
          currents are caused by wind and waves. Major ocean currents include
          the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic
          Circumpolar Current. Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of
          water and heat around the globe. This circulation significantly
          impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants
          such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface
          into the deep ocean.
