        <p>Meditation is not about trying to turn off your thoughts and emotions. It is about training in awareness and learning to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment.</p>

          <p>I have meditated for three hundred and forty-four days in a row. Now it's starting to feel like routine. It took time. And I still feel a restlessness and my thoughts wander in a single jumble. But I'm sitting. Still. Breathe me through it. Counting the breaths to help keep focus on the particular breaths. Lets the thoughts come and go. And trying to feel how the body feels. Right now. Notice and release. Not quite. The most difficult thing is probably not to evaluate how well the meditation goes. To not just accept that this is how it works today. I will continue to practice. Welcome to join!</p>

        <h2>How can I find the time to meditate in my busy schedule?</h2>

      <div class="answer" id="expanded">
        <p>Well, the great thing about meditation is that it doesn’t really take all that much time. As soon as you pick up the basics, you can begin by practicing for five or ten minutes each day. Mornings are generally best, at least to start..</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question" id="section2">
        <h2>How do I know if I’m meditating the right way?</h2>
        <img class="expand-icon" id="icon" src="plus.svg" alt="plus icon">
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="expanded">
        <p>This question reflects the goal-oriented perfectionist in you who monitors your activities to make sure you’re doing them right. The great thing about meditation is that you can’t do it wrong, short of not doing it at all. (In fact, it’s the perfectionist that causes most of your stress. And the point of meditation is to reduce stress, not intensify it.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question" id="section3">
        <h2>Can meditation really improve my health?</h2>
        <img class="expand-icon" id="icon" src="plus.svg" alt="plus icon">
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="expanded">
        <p>Yes, meditation can make you healthier, both physically and psychologically! Researchers have published hundreds of studies investigating the health benefits of meditation, and the results consistently indicate that people who meditate regularly have better health than those who don’t. Besides, meditation can actually reduce anxiety and lift depression.</p>

      <div class="question" id="section4">
        <h2>What should I do if I keep falling asleep while I meditate?</h2>
        <img class="expand-icon" id="icon" src="plus.svg" alt="plus icon">
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id="expanded">
        <p>Like restlessness, sleepiness is a common roadblock on the journey of meditation. First, you may want to explore the sleepiness a little. Where do you experience it in your body? Is it just mental dullness, or are you physically tired as well? Perhaps you should be napping rather than meditating!</p>
