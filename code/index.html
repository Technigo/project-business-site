                40 plus creatives were given the task of creating their own
                interpretation of a Cult, Classic or Obscure film poster from
                the past, whether it be a literal or abstract solution. The
                result is Now Showing, an Art exhibition paying homage to more
                than 70 years of film, through the form of Prints, One Off
                Screen Prints and Sculptures. Contributors were given the choice
                of working alone or in pairs; There was no colour, language or
                font restrictions.This project certainly wasn’t about
                redesigning “bad” film posters; that was far from its objective;
                Most contributors taking part picked films that already had
                beautifully executed solutions; Having said that, there is never
                just one solution to a creative brief, as some of the classic
                films proved.
