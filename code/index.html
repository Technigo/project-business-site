    <h2>What are they building in there?</h2>
  <p>As set dressers and film decor builders we often felt that something was missing when filming in rental studios. The lack of good workshops created a creative gap. For us, the best is to build directly on the spot and it allows better cooperation with the client. </p>
<p>We want to be a part of your creative process and give you the possibilitiy to use our craft and equippment in your work. The studio is as much a workshop as a space for unlimited ideas.</p></div>
