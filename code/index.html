        <div class="answer">
          <p>Study shows that mixed forests compared to monocultures provide higher 
            levels of multiple ecosystem services, including timber production.</p>

        <div class="question" id="section2">Things you didn't know - 2</div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Trees are a great carbon sink, with the world’s forests removing an estimated 2.1 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide annually – that’s 2.1 billion tonnes! 
            This plays a fundamental role in balancing the world’s carbon cycle and helping to combat climate change.</p>

        <div class="question" id="section3">Things you didn't know - 3</div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Forests have an abundant supply of nutritious foods, such as nuts, fruits, seeds and even insects which are rich in protein and important minerals such as calcium and iron. 
            These natural products help forest communities and millions of other people to remain healthy.

        <div class="question" id="section4">Things you didn't know - 4</div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Sustainably managed forests provide the primary raw material for paper, which is renewable and one of the most recycled materials in the world –
