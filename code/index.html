              each day and you can ride as much or as little as you wish. All our trips also include support vehicles that
              can give you a lift if needed. Our Non cycling tours are also very popular and are strictly non cycling.

              Organizers of large events such as The Tour de France & the Giro will release the exact timing and detailed itinerary
              for each stage about 2 months in advance. Many of our daily activities are based upon the race timing. As information 
              becomes available and our daily schedule is finalized, we will update you and your pre-departure packet will include 
              all the details.

              Your pre-travel information packet will also include an emergency phone number in the event that you are delayed and cannot make 
              it to the pick up location in time. We will do our best to find a convenient solution and pick you up. However, if the delay is 
              such that we cannot wait for you, you will have to make your own way to the first hotel.
