            The laboratory tasting session is the professional course of the
            tasting. You learn how to taste coffee and to narrow down the
            individual flavours in the cup by comparing the coffee to other
            flavours and aromas. We will guide you step by step so you too can
            enjoy coffee evaluation! No experience needed.

            Drop Coffee has a flavour vision of a clear and bright cup where the
            origin of the coffee should shine through. We like to present as
            much of the coffees’ acidity and sweetness as possible. Some coffees
            will be more acidic and juicy - and some creamy and chocolatey -
            depending on the origin, but all the coffees are roasted for
            clarity.

            Most of the ingredients used at our café are local, produced by
            small scale producers and mainly organic. Our origins of focus are
            Bolivia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador,
            Ethiopia and Kenya. We're crafting to perfection our preferred taste
            profile and maintaining our ethical business model with the
            producers.

            Our outdoor seating is open and our seatings has a 2 meters distance
            and cleaned off frequently. We serve the coffee at the table and ask
            you to hold a 2 meters distance in the line. If you’re not showing
            symptoms, you are heartily welcome to the café, to sit in or to go.
            As always, we are keeping our shelves filled with freshly roasted
            coffee from our roastery, to brew at home.
